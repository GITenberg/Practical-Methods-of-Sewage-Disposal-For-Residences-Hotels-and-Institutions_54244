</div>

<p class='c010'>The problem of sewage disposal for a single house differs
from the corresponding problem for a city chiefly in two ways:
first, because in the city it is becoming, if it has not, indeed,
already become, a necessity, and city authorities, though somewhat
reluctantly, are willing to grant the necessary appropriation
to secure engineering advice which will solve the problem
in a scientific as well as economic fashion. In the case of a
single house, whether a farm-house or a villa, the necessity of
employing competent engineering advice has not been generally
recognized, and no attempt has been made to solve the problem
of sewage disposal in a scientific manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cesspools have been considered the only way of caring for
sewage in places where a running stream was not available, or
where attempts were made to protect such a stream from
pollution, and while, in these last few years, crude attempts have
been made to utilize the so-called septic tank, such attempts
have generally been so unintelligent that the results have been
anything but satisfactory. Since it has been understood that
insects, such as flies and mosquitoes, play an important part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>in the transmission of disease, the danger of overflowing cesspools
and of open ditches in which stagnant sewage is present, has
been appreciated; also the higher standards of living which have
made themselves felt throughout the rural community have
demanded in farm-houses and country homes sanitary conveniences
which have hitherto been wanting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gradually every house is using more and more water for
various purposes, and living conditions, which in the past tolerated
a scanty supply drawn from a pump, are no longer endured.
The increased water supply and the demands of extended
plumbing mean a greater amount of sewage—so great an amount
that, in many cases, soils which could receive and digest the
waste waters from houses supplied by wells are clogged and
made impervious by this greater amount.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further, the danger to wells from the infiltration of cesspools
is more feared, and it is understood as never before that in order
to maintain the highest degree of health in a family the drinking-water
used must be above suspicion and not subject to contaminating
influences in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, communities are being aroused to the intrinsic value
of maintaining streams in a pure condition—partly because of
the value of fish and ice coming from the streams themselves,
and partly on the broad ground that watercourses belong to the
country as a whole, and must be kept pure for the sake of succeeding
generations, not spoiled for them on account of the selfishness
of a few at the present time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it is that to-day the problem of sewage disposal, while
arousing general interest, is recognized as one which requires
more than the common sense of an average person, that the
force and principles involved are understood to be not those
in common use, and that, for successful disposal of sewage,
special knowledge and judgment are required.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Whatever the character of the sewage and whatever the kind
of soil available for treatment, the method of dealing with
sewage most obvious to most people has been to discharge the
sewage directly into the nearest watercourse. This has been
the practice of cities as well as of individual houses in the past,
and the practice is very difficult to check because of the economy
of this method of disposal. In many cases there is no objection
to this method, and where a large stream is available,
where no use is made further downstream of the waters for
drinking purposes, and where the volume of water in the stream
is sufficient to dilute the sewage to a point where no odors or
objectionable appearances result, it would seem most uneconomical
to adopt any more complicated method of disposal than
by simply carrying the outfall pipe into the main bed of the
stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>In New York State, and in a number of other States, the
number of which is continually increasing, such direct discharge,
however, is not permitted by law except under certain conditions.
In New York State it is required that any house, butter or
cheese factory, manufacturing establishment, or village shall
obtain the permission of the State Commissioner of Health
before such a method of discharge be adopted, and in order to
obtain this permission it must be definitely shown that the
conditions of the stream are such that no reasonable objection
to this method could be urged. The policy of the various Departments
of Health in the United States is gradually becoming
more and more rigorous in the matter of prohibiting the discharge
of crude sewage into watercourses, and it is wise to make
very sure that the discharge of sewage into streams is above the
suspicion of a nuisance before adopting this as a suitable method.
Rather would it seem better to provide for some method of treatment
and allow only purified sewage to go into the stream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>than to run the risk of being forced in a few years to reconstruct
the entire line of outfall pipe, with perhaps an entire
reconstruction of the plumbing within the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>The problem of treatment is the question of so modifying
the character of a large volume of dirty water that it shall neither
injure the quality of any drinking-water into which it may be
discharged, nor cause objectionable odors, nor present disagreeable
appearances in any body of water into which it may
be emptied.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to properly understand a reasonable method of
treatment some consideration must be given to the composition
of sewage. This is chiefly water with which is mixed a small
amount of animal, vegetable, and mineral matter. Roughly
speaking, the amount of mineral dirt is about one tablespoonful
to a barrelful of water, and the combined amount of animal and
vegetable matter amounts to another tablespoonful. It seems
almost impossible that so small a quantity of organic matter
as one tablespoonful in a barrel of water could cause offense
in any way, and yet engineers, city officials, and householders
know by bitter experience that, when spread out on the surface
of the ground or when allowed to stand in pools, water so polluted
will undergo putrefaction resulting in most disagreeable
odors and in complete stagnation. The problem of sewage
treatment, then, consists in removing from the barrelful of water,
the tablespoonful of organic dirt, whether animal or vegetable,
in such a way that no odors shall be occasioned by the process
and at the same time so that the cost of the process may be a
reasonable one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately, the greater part of this organic matter is in
solution, dissolved, like salt in water, so that, though undeniably
present, it must be removed by some process more complicated
and less obvious than that of simple straining. It would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>comparatively simple if the polluting substances remained
floating or suspended in the water. Then they could be strained
out through a fine sieve or settled out in a tank, either with
or without the aid of chemicals. But for particles in solution,
straining, by itself, is useless and, while in large plants frequent
use is made of sieves as a complement to the main process of
purification, in small plants it is of so little value as hardly
to deserve consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another factor enters to lessen the value of the use of screens
or sieves in an installation for a single house. A great deal
of the organic matter found in sewers requires both agitation and
time for its subdivision into particles small enough to be acted
upon in any process of purification adopted. If a screen is used,
large particles of putrescible matter are held on the screen
since not enough time has existed to break down their mass,
and thus the screen itself becomes a most emphatic disturbance
and a most objectionable feature of the purification plant.</p>

<p class='c000'>For efficient purification, therefore, some method of reducing
and modifying the character of organic solids, particularly those
in solution, must be selected. In seeking a method by which
this may be accomplished, scientific men found years ago that
this very process was being carried on continually by natural forces,
although at a very slow rate of purification. All organic
matter, however formed and wherever present, is subject to
the natural forces of decay. Fruits, vegetables, and meats
of all kinds, exposed to the air, rapidly lose their original character
and form and in the course of time disappear entirely.
Except for this provision of nature, the accumulation of organic
wastes since the beginning of the earth’s occupation by human
beings would be so great that the earth would be uninhabitable
on account of the deposits of waste matter which would have
formed by this time. Nature, then, recognizes the need of disposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of organic wastes, and her method is the one which
apparently must be followed by human beings if successful
treatment is to be secured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only a few decades ago, it was found that this process of
decay was due to the activity of very small organisms known as
bacteria, and their agency was proved by experiments which
showed that if vegetables or meat were kept free from bacteria,
no decay, fermentation, or putrefaction took place. It was
proved that the air itself was not responsible because in certain
experiments air was allowed to enter through a filtering medium
fine enough to strain out the bacteria and no decay took place,
although oxygen and air were both freely admitted. It is well
understood by the housewife that fruits can be kept indefinitely
if they are cooked sufficiently to kill any bacteria present and
then sealed in bacteria-free, air-tight jars. When such preserves
spoil, it is because some bacteria were left in the jar or have
since been admitted through an imperfect top. When decay is
allowed to proceed, the obvious result is, first of all, a softening
of the material, as in the case of a rotten apple, a liquefaction,
as it is more technically known. Following that part of the
process is a gradual breaking down of the material, the residue
being of an earthy character which is assimilated by the soil
into which it falls.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bacteria required for the putrefaction of organic matter
are among the most widely distributed of all the micro-organisms.
They are always found in the air, except on mountain tops,
in deserts, and over the ocean. They are very numerous in
surface waters, such as streams and ponds, and their relative
number everywhere increases as the amount of organic matter
increases, so that the greater the need for them the greater
is their number. It has been found that the great majority
of these bacteria require air for their energetic development,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and this fact is most important when it comes to the practical
construction of a piece of apparatus for making use of these
bacteria. It has also been found that, for several reasons,
these bacteria work most effectively in the soil and can take care
of a larger quantity of organic matter there than elsewhere. This
is partly because in the surface layers of the soil, particularly
where that soil has been cultivated, a great number of the
particular bacteria involved in decay are always to be found.
Pure, clean sand from the desert contains almost none of these
beneficent bacteria. Rich garden soil is fairly teeming with
them, so that, curiously, the more organic matter and the more
bacteria present in any soil, the more active that soil will be in
taking care of other organic matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, again, the soil particles, particularly in sandy soil,
are so separated as to allow between them a certain and appreciable
amount of air, and by means of this air the activity of
the bacteria is made continuous and the products of their activity
utilized. Without such an admission of air, the bacteria are
choked and diminish rapidly in numbers. There is, however, a
definite degree of purification and a certain quantity of organic
matter which can be taken care of by the bacteria incident to any
particular soil. Up to that quantity purification proceeds
more or less satisfactorily according to the intelligence shown in
feeding the bacteria in such a way as suits their convenience.
If, however, that quantity be exceeded, all purification stops,
the bacteria are apparently discouraged, and no further improvements
can be expected. A fine-grained soil will not be so useful
as a coarse-grained soil because the former does not allow
sufficient air in the interstices of its soil particles. Another
practical reason for not making use of soils of fine grains is that
such soils can absorb only a small amount of liquid because
of the mechanical construction of the material. On the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>hand, soils whose grains are too coarse are undesirable because
their mechanical construction is such that the liquids containing
organic matter in solution pass through so rapidly that time
enough is not given for bacterial action.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a result of the principles just enumerated, it may be
said that there are three distinct and essential conditions for
the successful disposal of sewage through the soil. These three
conditions are, first, a rate of application suitable to the soil
which it is proposed to use; second, an interrupted or intermittent
delivery of the sewage so that the bacteria can obtain,
between consecutive doses of sewage, the necessary amount of
oxygen for their own preservation and well-being; and, third,
a resting period in which is carried forward that intimate association
between the partly decomposed organic matter and the
oxygen or air present in the pores of the soil by which the final
oxidation is obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rate of application varies, as already indicated, with the
size of particles found in the soil, and it should also vary with
the purification desired. The larger the particles, the higher may
be the rate of application, but less efficient will be the process.
With grains of sand as fine as <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>200</sub> of an inch, and with a rate
of application not greater than five gallons per square yard of
surface per day, filtration through such an area has been proved
to be capable of removing from the foulest sewage all the objectionable
material and converting the liquid into what is an
equivalent of the purest spring water. If the rate appropriate
to this particular soil is exceeded, the efficiency decreases, and
the unmistakable and inevitable result is to stop all purification
and convert the filter into a stagnant cesspool. If, to take the
other extreme, the soil particles are increased until they are
as large as hen’s eggs, then, if the rate of application is not
greater than 200 gallons per square yard of surface per day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and if the method and rate of application are suitable to this
large amount, the resulting effluent is sufficiently freed from its
objectionable matter so that the liquid can be turned into any
body of water without danger of odors or other nuisance. If
this rate is exceeded, or if the method of application is not
carefully considered, the resulting effluent is foul in the extreme
and the process itself becomes a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It can be seen by this brief explanation that it is not possible
to assign any particular rate of application to any particular
kind of treatment, since in all the methods of purification which
have been worked out considerable variation in the details of
that particular method have been practised. It will be possible,
therefore, in succeeding chapters to indicate by the size of filters
recommended only limiting or average values for rates of
purification, since those rates are always dependent upon other
factors than the particular method being discussed. It must
also be remembered that soils may exist which have no porosity
whatever, and through which it is impossible for sewage to make
its way. Such soils are not available for sewage purification,
and, no matter how small the rate or how careful the method
of application, such areas will fail to produce any practical
purification. Soils like clay, peat, and fine water-deposited silt
are of this sort. Clay soils may sometimes become pulverized
by cultivation so that they will ultimately be able to take
care of a moderate amount of sewage. In such a case it is possible
to dispose of sewage successfully in the top six inches of soil
which, by continual cultivation, has been made out of the stiff
clay. In such cases, the difficulty is not that of oxidizing the
sewage, but that of taking care of the effluent, which must be
held between the cultivated soil and the raw clay underneath.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second requirement mentioned is secured by discharging
the sewage onto the soil area at intervals, the number of doses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>per day depending upon the size of particles in the bed. There
has been a general principle established that the size of these
doses ought to be smaller as the size of the particles increases,
so that, whereas in the case of sand beds the total daily dose
is usually divided into from one to three parts and each part
delivered onto the bed with an appropriate interval, in the
case of coarser materials used for sprinkling filters, the time
interval between doses is much reduced and in some installations
recently constructed in England that interval has been measured
in seconds. The variations in the rate of flow of sewage onto
any filter, however, are so great that any such requirement as
designing discharging apparatus to work at intervals of a few
seconds is useless, and if as small an interval as one minute is
provided for the coarsest material for the maximum rate of flow
at any time of the day, the installation will probably be successful
for the lesser rates occurring at other times of the day.
As an indication of the way in which this modification is made,
it is customary, when the size of soil particles is that of peas,
to make the interval between successive discharges about one
hour, so that the dose applied at any one time would be equal to
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>24</sub> of the daily volume. With gravel filling, the particles being
the size of English walnuts, the interval between doses is shortened
to five minutes, and the amount of any one dose is thus made
1 about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>280</sub> of the total daily volume. With the coarser filling,
as when a size as large as hen’s eggs is used, the interval would
be cut down to about one minute. It should be added that the
intervals last mentioned are characteristic only of some devices
used for dosing sprinkling filters and that there is a wide divergence
of practice among engineers when dealing with any particular
size of sand or stone particles in all kinds of filter beds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third requirement, namely, the occasional resting of
the bed, is met by providing some additional area over that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>theoretically required, so that the flow may be diverted from part
to part of the total area (which is usually divided into beds for
this purpose), and in this way each part is allowed, in turn, a
period for resting. For example, if the required area be divided
into two beds and a third bed added equal in area to one of the
two and a regular rotation of dosing be practised, each bed would
rest not only the time between the regular twelve-hour period
dosing, but might also be given a complete rest, occasionally,
for an extended period. This third requirement is probably less
imperative with the coarser particles and there are many
examples of coarse-grained beds which have been continuously
operated for a period of years. It is found, however, that with
such treatment clogging is inevitable, and that such clogging is
partially relieved by a period of rest somewhat proportional
to the length of time the beds have been operated. It is, then,
only shortsighted policy to economize at the beginning and
attempt to save money by not building an additional area,
since the clogging of the whole plant is bound to occur in the
course of time, and then another plant must be built or the
material forming the bed taken out, washed, and replaced.
Otherwise the sewage must go unpurified to the outfall while
the bed is recovering from the long period of overwork.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is convenient to divide sewage purification into two
processes, the preliminary process and the final, or finishing
process, and, while the preliminary process, in itself, never
accomplishes purification, yet it is of considerable value in facilitating
and increasing the rate and efficiency of that purification.
The most common preliminary treatment is sedimentation, by
which the larger solids in suspension are allowed to settle in
a tank or tanks so that the filter beds later used are relieved
from the accumulation of those deposits. Under the name of
septic tank such a receptacle for suspended solids has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>exploited as a complete method of purification, and many
underground tanks have been constructed in various parts of
the country which have, at the time of their installation, been
considered competent to furnish all the necessary purification.
When it is remembered that less than one-half of the organic
matter in sewage is in suspension and that the best results in
any sort of a tank succeed in depositing only one-half of those
suspended solids, it can readily be seen that a tank, whether
called septic or settling, cannot be a complete method of treatment.
In reality, such a tank does little more than take out
from the sewage the greasy material and a certain proportion of
the suspended matter. Whatever part of this is organic matter
may, by a particular arrangement of the tank, be considerably
reduced in quantity, so that the intervals of cleaning can be
extended, but in every tank the removal of the deposits is
necessary, and subsequent treatment is required if adequate
purification is accomplished.</p>

<p class='c000'>The final, or finishing, process may be carried out according
to any one of several methods. It may be done by discharging
the tank effluent into a system of agricultural drains laid just
below the surface of the ground, called sub-surface irrigation.
It may be done by removing the top soil from a bed of sand
placed by nature, and needing little except suitable surface
distribution to insure the most efficient purification.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a small plant, instead of a sand filter, for which the
sand is found naturally in a suitable location, an artificial filter
may be built by preparing an enclosure and carting in sand for
filling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where no sand is available, or where its use would be uneconomical,
broken stone may be used to ensure final treatment.
With stone, on account of its large voids, the enclosure must
either be water-tight, and the outlet pipe must be provided with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>a valve or other device so that the sewage under treatment may
be held in the enclosure or tank long enough to deposit the solids
in suspension and to be acted on by the bacteria concerned.
This method is known as the contact bed treatment. Or, finally,
the desired results may be obtained by spraying the sewage
onto a deep layer of broken stone, the method being called
the sprinkling filter treatment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The choice of the final treatment, in any particular case,
depends on the character and slope of the ground, on the availability
and cost of sand or of broken stone, and on the amount
of sewage to be treated. It is hoped that the following pages
will give to the reader both an intelligent appreciation of the
advantages and disadvantages of each of the several methods of
sewage purification discussed, and also sufficient insight into the
necessary details of construction so that the method chosen
can be put into successful operation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>THE SETTLING TANK AND ITS CONSTRUCTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As has been stated, a most effective preliminary step in the
treatment of sewage is to pass it through a properly designed
settling tank in order that the grosser solids and suspended
matters as far as possible may be deposited there and finally
disposed of separately from the liquid sewage. This partial
removal of the suspended matters, amounting to about fifty per
cent. in well-designed and carefully operated tanks, very materially
aids in the final treatment of sewage on filters or on sub-surface
irrigation areas by preventing clogging of the filters or
of the piping in the irrigation system.</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with the larger settling tanks for hotels or
institutions, it is sometimes advisable to pass the sewage first
through a screen chamber before it is discharged into the
settling tank, in order that the grosser suspended solids may be
collected more easily than from the tank; but, as has been
pointed out, screening of sewage is not necessary at small disposal
plants, and in fact is not generally advisable owing to the
continual labor involved in removing and disposing of the
screenings, and no description of screening plants will therefore
be given.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old method of discharging sewage and house wastes into
loose-walled cesspools on all occasions and under all sorts of
conditions is rapidly changing, as is desirable. True, in certain
locations, where ample area is available, where the soil is dry
and porous, and where neither springs nor wells nor the soil near
dwellings will be contaminated thereby, cesspools may be safely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>used. In other locations a small expenditure of time and money
will provide the means by which nature’s processes of reduction
of the organic matter in sewage may be carried on much more
efficiently and satisfactorily than ever can be the case in a
cesspool.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The scheme for properly disposing of sewage at any point
should therefore include its sedimentation in a settling tank of
proper construction and ample capacity, whether its final treatment
is to be effected by sub-surface irrigation, intermittent
sand filtration, contact beds, or sprinkling filters. Where the
sewage effluent is to be discharged into a stream or body of water
of comparatively large flow or volume, and where that stream is
not subsequently used as a potable water supply, it is sometimes
permissible to subject the sewage to settling tank treatment
only. Such partial treatment, however, should be arranged for
only as a temporary measure, and the tank should be so constructed
with respect to the elevation of adjacent areas that
works for final treatment of sewage, when required, may be
constructed as advantageously as possible. Moreover, in the
more progressive States, as noted in Chapter I, the purity of
streams is being carefully safeguarded, and the general tendency
of public health officials is to require more complete treatment
of sewage before its discharge into a watercourse than is accomplished
by settling tanks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The settling tank for residences and institutions, as shown
in Fig. <a href='#fig1'>1</a>, should have a capacity of from five to fifteen cubic
feet for each person served by the sewer in order that proper
time of detention in the tank may be allowed for the sedimentation
of the suspended matters in the sewage. The depth of the
tank should be from five to eight feet, and its width should
generally be from one-third to one-half the length. Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a> shows
a longitudinal section of the settling tank and siphon chamber.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 3.</span>—Sketch of Settling Tank with Longitudinal Partition Wall.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The dimensions of settling tanks given above provide for
longer periods of detention in the case of the smaller tanks than
in that of the larger, an excess which is necessary on account of
the greater fluctuation in the flow of sewage reaching the smaller
tanks. The larger tanks may be better and more conveniently
operated if they are divided by a longitudinal partition wall as
shown by Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>, and arranged for in the table for tanks serving
250 or more persons. This provision is not so necessary in the
case of the smaller tanks, especially if they are to be installed
at summer resorts or country homes occupied for only a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>months in the summer. If, however, the tanks are to be operated
continuously they may have two chambers for greater convenience
in removing sludge. The flow through one compartment
may then be stopped by closing a valve placed on the inlet
pipe to that compartment, or by inserting one of the stop-planks
or sluices in a diverting chamber, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>, at
the left of the tank and inserting a ten-inch board in the groove
over the outlet weir wall of the compartment to be cleaned. The
entire flow of sewage is then passed through the other compartment
while the first is being cleaned. This division of the
tank into two compartments is sometimes desirable in the
case of the smaller tanks and may easily be accomplished. For
instance, instead of a tank 6 feet by 12 feet, two compartments
may be arranged for, each 3 feet 6 inches by 10 feet; and
instead of a tank 8 feet by 20 feet, two compartments may be
constructed, each 5 feet wide and 16 feet long.</p>

<p class='c000'>The settling tank should be located as far as conveniently
possible from the dwelling, and especially from any wells or
springs, in order that leakage of sewage, which may always occur,
will not lead to the contamination of a water supply or of the
soil near the residence. It may not be possible in every case
to locate such tanks more than fifty feet away from the house
or from the well, but the distance should never be less than this,
and when located at this minimum distance from the dwelling
or from a well, especial care should be used to make the tank
water-tight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The walls of the tank should preferably be constructed of
concrete, although they may be built of brick or wood. The
last material is often the cheapest, and tanks constructed of
lumber will last for several years without renewal. The concrete
tank, however, is more easily made water-tight, and is a permanent
structure. The walls of the tank, when the height is less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>than 8 or 10 feet, should be 8 inches thick at the top, and
should have a batter on the inside of 1½ inches per foot of height.
If the tank is to be built with two compartments, the partition
wall should be 10 or 12 inches thick at the top and should have
a batter on both sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tank should generally be placed with its top at the
level of the ground surface, and the sewer from the house should
enter the end of the tank with its flow line or invert 12 inches
below the top of the walls. The house sewer or drain should have
a grade or fall of not less than 9 inches in 100 feet. Preferably,
the sewer should be laid at the above minimum grade for at
least 50 feet or so before it enters the tank in order to prevent
excessive velocity in the sewage flow at this point. At the
entrance to the tank the sewer should be provided with an
elbow so that the sewage will be discharged downward below the
surface. Similarly, if an outlet pipe from the tank is used, as
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig5'>5</a>, this pipe should pass through the wall at the
outlet end of the tank, one foot below the top of the tank, and
should also be provided with an elbow which will start from
below the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where a siphon is to be used to discharge the effluent from
the tank onto a filter or into a system of sub-surface tiling,
the separate chamber in which the siphon must be placed may
be built as an extension of the settling tank so that the end wall
of the settling tank will serve as one of the walls of the siphon
chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>The siphon chamber floor may be placed considerably above
the level of the floor of the tank as shown in Figs. <a href='#fig2'>2</a> and <a href='#fig3'>3</a>,
since a sufficiently large quantity of effluent for dosing a filter
or a sub-surface irrigation system may be collected in the
chamber of reduced depth thus provided. This shallower construction
saves excavation and also reduces the operating head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>or fall, which latter is sometimes hardly equal to the demands
of the subsequent treatment. The capacity needed in this
chamber for different installations will be given later in the
discussion of sewage filters and sub-surface irrigation systems.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having determined upon the dimensions of the tank and
selected the site, the construction is commenced by making
the excavation about four feet wider and longer than the outside
dimensions of the tank and siphon chamber combined, in order
to provide room for setting the forms for placing the concrete,
provided concrete is to be used in its construction. With brick
walls an additional width and length of two feet is needed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig4'>4</a> gives an illustration of the forms to be used in constructing
the walls for concrete tanks, the cut at the left showing
a view of the form to be used when the tank is constructed either
partly or wholly above the natural ground surface, or below the
surface in loose soils, and the cut at the right showing a view
of the form to be used when excavation for the tank is made in
rock, hardpan, or clay. The top width of the walls should be
8 inches, and the bottom width should be 8 inches plus 1½
inches for each foot of height. Thus, for a wall 6 feet high the
bottom width should be 17 inches,—the inside face of the wall
having a batter of 1½ inches per foot of height. This batter is
necessary, when the tank is constructed below the ground surface,
to withstand the lateral earth pressure when the tank is
empty. If the tank is to be constructed above the ground
surface, the outside wall should be battered and the inside wall
made vertical, since the pressure which the wall must withstand
is then only from the liquid within the tank. The partition
wall between the settling tank and siphon chamber should
be 10 or 12 inches thick at the top, depending on its height,
and should have a batter on both sides.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 4.</span>—Forms Used for Building Side Walls for Concrete Tank.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To set up the forms for the concrete walls, stakes 2 inches by
4 inches and about 2½ feet long are first driven on each side
of the bottom of the wall, and 6 inches away from the wall as
laid out, at intervals of 2 feet. Pieces of scantling, 2 inches by
4 inches and with a length equal to the height of the wall, are
then placed in upright position and securely nailed to these
stakes. The inner scantling are then inclined and temporarily
fastened at the top by a short nailing piece to the outer row so
as to leave an opening of 10 inches between each pair of scantling.
Additional stakes are then driven from 2 to 4 feet from the wall
on each side, as shown in the illustration, and braces 2 inches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>thick and 3 inches or 4 inches wide are nailed to these stakes
and to the upright and inclined scantling. One-inch boards
are then lightly nailed to the scantling, as shown, the boards
making up the inside face of the form being placed in sections of
two feet in order to afford opportunity for thorough tamping of
the concrete as the form is being filled. The concrete is then
placed between the boarded sides of the form in 6–inch layers
and well rammed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The concrete should be composed of one part by measure
of Portland cement to two and a half parts of clean, sharp
building sand and five parts of broken stone or clean gravel.
The cement and sand should first be thoroughly mixed, while
dry, to an even color and then wet and tempered to a soft mortar.
The broken stone or gravel, after having first been thoroughly
wet, should be spread evenly over the batch of mortar and the
mass shoveled over at least three times to insure a thorough
coating of the stones with mortar. The concrete thus made may
then be placed in the forms in six-inch depths and thoroughly
rammed until water covers the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it is essential that the tank be water-tight, and, in fact,
in constructing all tanks, each layer of concrete should be
placed between the forms, when possible, before the concrete
in the layer previously placed has set. If the work of placing the
concrete is of necessity interrupted, before placing another
layer the surface of the older concrete should first be sprinkled
and swept with a stiff broom and a thin coating of neat cement
mortar (containing no sand) should then be washed over the
surface of the concrete.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be noted that a barrel of Portland cement (equal to
four bags) contains 3.8 cubic feet, so for concrete with the
proportions of cement, sand, and stone as specified above, for
each barrel of cement used there should be used 9.5 cubic feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of loose sand and 19 cubic feet of loose stone; and for each
cubic yard of concrete required there will be needed 1.30 barrels
(or 5.2 bags) of cement, 0.46 cubic yards of sand, and 0.92 cubic
yards of stone if the stone is fairly uniform in size and contains
forty-five per cent. of voids. With stone or gravel less uniform in
size, less cement and sand is required. The cement and sand,
made into mortar, will fill the voids or open spaces in the mass
of broken stone. (For further details see Chapter VII.)</p>

<p class='c000'>As shown in the illustration (Fig. <a href='#fig4'>4</a>), the foot of each upright
and inclined scantling should be placed at the proposed elevation
of the floor of the tank, and the boarding should not be
carried below this level. Then, if the excavation for the wall
has been carried to a level 6 or 8 inches lower than the
floor of the tank, the concrete when being placed between the
forms will spread under the bottom of the forms, making a footing
for the wall on the outside and better insuring a water-tight
joint when the floor is laid against the inside foot of the walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>In making the excavation for the tank, after reaching the
proposed level for the floor a trench should be cut around the
floor space to a depth of 6 to 8 inches below the floor level.
The width of this trench should be such as to extend from 6
to 8 inches inside and an equal distance outside the wall at the
floor level. After the walls have been constructed as described,
the forms should be left in place for at least 24 hours, to allow
the concrete to set, and then removed. The excavation inside
the walls should then be carried 6 inches below the floor level,
the soil well tamped, and a 6–inch layer of concrete placed to
form the floor of the tank. It is well to sprinkle all concrete
daily until it has thoroughly set.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the type of siphon selected has a U-shaped pipe extending
below the floor of the siphon chamber, it will be necessary to
set the siphon in position while the floor is being laid and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>discharge pipe in position while the wall is being laid. The
siphon should be so placed that the bottom of the bell over the
longer leg is 3 inches above the floor of the siphon chamber
or of the sump in the siphon chamber if such a depression is made
in the construction of the floor.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The floor of the tank should slope toward the inlet end
at a rate of one-half inch per foot of length in order to facilitate
the removal of sludge when the tank is being cleaned. This will
result in providing a somewhat greater depth at the inlet end
of the tank than is shown by the tables, and a lesser depth at
the outlet end, leaving the depth at the centre of the tank as
shown. The inlet and outlet pipes to the tank, which should be
of cast iron, should be placed in position through the forms
while the walls are being laid.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it is desired to have an outlet pipe from the tank
near the bottom (see pipe A, Fig. <a href='#fig5'>5</a>), for the purpose of drawing
off the supernatant liquid, and so saving the labor of removing
the liquid by pail when the tank is being cleaned, this pipe
should be of cast iron, 4 inches in diameter and fitted with a valve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and valve rod placed outside the tank, and should also be placed
in position during the construction of the tank. The valve rod,
or stem, should reach to the surface of the ground through a
3–inch pipe casing. The lower outlet pipe should be extended
around the siphon chamber to discharge into the effluent pipe
leading away from this chamber, when possible. This lower
outlet pipe should leave the tank at least one foot above the floor
and sometimes at a higher elevation, in order to discharge into
the sewer leading to the irrigation field or to the filter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pipe B in Fig. <a href='#fig5'>5</a> shows a sludge pipe which may be laid to a
suitable site for disposing of sludge from the tank when the
slope of the land will permit the draining of the sludge by
gravity into trenches or onto a sludge bed. This sludge pipe
should be fitted with a valve and valve stem, and the valve
may be inside the tank, as shown in the illustration, or outside
the tank, as shown on pipe A. If such an arrangement for disposing
of sludge is possible, it is manifestly unnecessary to provide
pipe A as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig5'>5</a>, since the supernatant liquid as well
as the sludge may then be piped to a sludge bed or pit. This
bed should be shallow, but of ample capacity to hold the entire
contents of the settling tank. The sludge may then be drawn
off about every six weeks, thereby operating the tank as a
settling tank rather than as a septic tank. It will be found after
scum of a certain thickness has formed on the surface of the
sewage in the tank that the thickness will not materially
increase.</p>

<p class='c000'>The roof of the tank should preferably be of concrete reënforced
with iron rods, although it may be of brick arches or of
two-inch planking. The use of brick for the roof is not advisable,
however, since the forms for the construction of the arches are
rather difficult to make, and brick roofs are apt to be broken
down sooner or later through the action of frost. A wooden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>roof, also, must be renewed at intervals and is not as satisfactory
as a concrete roof.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 6.</span>—Section Showing Tank with Concrete Roof and with Form for Constructing Roof.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A section of a tank with a concrete roof is shown by Fig. <a href='#fig6'>6</a>,
together with the temporary form built up inside the tank on
which to lay the roof. The form is built by setting 2–inch by
4–inch scantling on wedges along the walls of the tank in pairs
18 inches apart and bracing these at the foot. Boards 1½
inches thick and 10 inches wide are then nailed across the tank
to the tops of the scantling, the top edges of the boards being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>1 inch below the top of the walls. A false roof is then made
of boards nailed lengthwise of the tank to the 10–inch boards,
and a layer of concrete 2 inches thick is then placed on the floor
thus made, reaching over the top of the walls to the outside
edges. Iron rods, ¾ of an inch thick and spaced 1 foot apart,
are then placed on the concrete across the tank and reaching
to within 1 inch of the outside edges of the walls. More concrete
is then placed over the first layer to a total depth of 6
inches or 8 inches, depending on the width of the tank, the
concrete being well rammed as it is placed. After the concrete
has set, the wedges may be knocked from under the upright
scantling and the form taken down and removed through the
manhole. The manhole covers and frames, as shown in the
illustrations in Chapter III, may be cast at local foundries or
purchased through sewer-pipe dealers.</p>

<p class='c000'>To provide manholes or openings through the roof into the
tank and into the siphon chamber, round openings 2 feet in
diameter should be cut in the false roof while it is being laid,
the distance between the pairs of scantling at this point being
made 2 feet. The manhole frames should then be so placed
that the flange or base of the frame will be imbedded to a depth
of 2 inches in the roof when completed. The manhole at the
entrance end of the tank should be located at one side of the
entrance pipe and over the valve on the sludge pipe. To provide
the necessary opening through the concrete roof below the
manhole frame, an eight-sided wooden form, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig7'>7</a>,
with an inner diameter of 2 feet and a height equal to 2½ inches
less than the thickness of the roof, is placed over the opening in
the false roof. On this wooden form the manhole frame is placed
and the concrete laid around the form and over the flanges
of the manhole frame. Two of the ¾-inch iron rods should be
placed across the tank close to each side of the wooden form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>after the first 2–inch layer of the concrete roof has been
placed.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 7.</span>—Form for Manhole Opening.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When it is desired to carry the manhole some distance above
the level of the top of the roof to provide for a rather deep
earth covering for the tank, the
eight-sided wooden form may be
made deeper as desired, and
another larger, similar form built
for the outside form of the
necessary concrete manhole well.
The space between the two forms
may then be filled with concrete
and the manhole frame set on the octagonal-shaped wall
thus formed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to insure a more uniform flow of sewage through
the tank and thus reduce the velocity of flow in all portions
to a minimum, baffle boards of 2–inch planks should be placed
across the tank near the inlet pipe and near the outlet pipe, as
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig5'>5</a>. These boards are set in grooves formed in the
concrete by nailing 1–inch by 3–inch strips to the inside
form when the tank wall is constructed. These baffles also
serve a useful purpose by reducing the disturbance of the scum
as the sewage enters the tank and by preventing the escape of
scum from the tank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boards should extend to a depth of one foot below the
inlet and outlet pipes, and should usually be placed 12 to
18 inches from the ends of the tank. Where the effluent
from the tank is to be collected in a siphon chamber adjoining
the tank, it is preferable to provide a weir or wall between the
tank and the siphon chamber. The top of this wall should be
one foot below the roof to allow the effluent to flow over this
wall from the tank into the siphon chamber. In this case no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>outlet pipe from the tank is used, and the baffle boards should
extend downward 12 inches below the level of the sewage in
the tank. These baffle boards should be carried up to a level
with the top of the tank walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is advisable to provide an overflow pipe from the siphon
chamber which should leave this chamber at an elevation of
3 or 4 inches above that of the inlet pipe to the tank,
and which should, by means of an elbow, be extended down
outside the chamber to connect with the sewer into which the
siphon discharges. This is desirable in order to provide an
overflow in case the siphon becomes clogged or fails to operate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where a tank must of necessity be located near a residence,
any nuisance due to odors may be prevented by inserting a
4–inch galvanized-iron conductor-pipe through the roof of
the tank, and carrying this pipe up into the air 20 or 30 feet
along a tree trunk or the side of a building.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a sub-surface irrigation field is to be laid out, the tank
should preferably be near the proposed location of the sub-surface
irrigation area (see Fig. <a href='#fig26'>26</a>, Chapter IV), although the
effluent may be carried to the sub-surface irrigation field from
a settling tank located at some distance from such field. Since
the sewage enters the tank near the top of the tank and the
effluent discharges from the siphon chamber at a considerable
distance below the top of the tank, it is of advantage to place
the settling tank on sloping ground, if possible, so that one end
will be wholly in excavation and the other will be partly above
the natural ground surface. This reduces the depth of trenching
and provides for more readily distributing the effluent by gravity
from the tank through the sub-surface tiling which is laid just
below the surface of the ground. The tank must always be higher
than the distributing field to allow for the flow of sewage, and
it is desirable to have the tank buried in the ground if possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in order to keep the temperature of the sewage as high as possible
in winter. These ideal conditions are not always to be attained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The one important point to be kept in mind if the settling
tank is to be properly operated and not allowed to develop into a
nuisance is that the sludge or sediment must be removed from
the bottom of the tank at intervals before the effective capacity
of the tank is so reduced that the proper sedimentation of the
sewage is impossible. The frequency of cleaning necessary varies
in different cases, but usually the tank should be emptied and
cleaned at intervals of from three months to one year, and where
the contour of the ground allows the sludge to be readily drawn
off into trenches or to a sludge bed, cleaning should be practised
every five or six weeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is, perhaps, little need for cleaning the tank as often
as once in six weeks, but it is generally found and has been
affirmed in court testimony that the removing of the sludge from
a settling tank once every six weeks will prevent septic action
from taking place, and the tank will then be operated as a
settling tank and not as a septic tank. This is desirable in view
of the fact that royalties have been claimed under certain
patents on septic tanks. As explained on p. <a href='#Page_11'>11</a>, the important
function of the tank is to settle out suspended solids, while
the processes that take place in the septic tank but not in the
settling tank are of minor importance, and it is advisable
therefore to operate these tanks as settling tanks when possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>In no case should the sludge be allowed to accumulate
until it fills more than one-quarter of the tank. The sludge
may be disposed of by burying in trenches or ploughing under,
or it may be spread on the surface at points remote from highways
and dwellings or sources of water supply. The depth of
accumulated matter in the tank should frequently be tested at
the inlet end by using a pole or stick.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 9.</span>—Vertical Cross-Section of Modified Imhoff Tank.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In reference to the preliminary treatment of sewage in
tanks, it should be noted that the most recent development in
the design of sewage-disposal plants has been the improved
method of sedimentation of sewage represented by the Imhoff
or Emscher tank. A modified design of this tank is shown in
plan and longitudinal section in Fig. <a href='#fig8'>8</a>, and a cross-section of
the tank is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig9'>9</a>. The principle employed is to provide
a separate chamber for storing the sludge which results from
the sedimentation of the suspended matters in the sewage,
this chamber being almost entirely separated from the portion
of the tank in which the sedimentation takes place. This
separation of the sludge from the flowing sewage is accomplished
in the tank shown by inserting in the tank, parallel
with the side walls, two inner partitions <em>AA</em>, which are vertical
for a few feet below the surface of the sewage and then slope
toward the centre line of the tank, but, as shown by Fig. <a href='#fig9'>9</a>, do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>not meet at the centre line, the one passing a few inches under
the other. The opening or slot thus formed between the two
inner partitions allows the suspended matters which settle out
of the sewage flowing through the upper compartment to pass
into the lower or sludge compartment and there remain in a
quiescent state until removed from the tank. The object of this
separation of the sludge from the flowing sewage is to prevent
the gas bubbles which emanate from the sludge during its
decomposition from rising through the flowing sewage and interfering
with the process of sedimentation going on in the upper
compartment, and to provide for a more complete decomposition
or “digestion” of the sludge. The gas bubbles on rising
from the deposited sludge strike the sloping lower sections of
the inner partitions and are deflected to the portions of the
tank next to the outside walls. A sludge pipe leads away from
the bottom of the hopper-shaped sludge compartment, and at
intervals of from one to four weeks the valve on this sludge
pipe is opened for a short time and a small portion of the accumulated
sludge is allowed to be forced out onto a sludge-drying
bed by the weight of the sewage in the tank. The portion of
the sludge thus removed has, of course, remained in the tank
the longest time, generally five or six months, and has had the
fullest opportunity to be reduced and rendered inodorous and
easy to dispose of.</p>

<p class='c000'>This method of sedimentation was first experimented with
about twelve years ago by Mr. H. W. Clark at the Lawrence
Experiment Station of the Massachusetts State Board of Health,
then partially developed by Dr. W. Owen Travis, of Hampton,
England, and finally worked out by Dr. Ing. Carl Imhoff in
connection with the disposal of sewage in the Emscher River
district in Germany. The method has been extensively and
successfully used in Germany, and similar tanks are now being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>installed in this country. While these tanks are probably more
effective than septic tanks and the usual type of settling tanks
in the removal of suspended matters in sewage, their chief value
will undoubtedly be found in the rendering of the sludge less
odorous and more easily handled. This form of settling tank
is covered by patents, and a moderate royalty is charged on tanks
of this type.</p>

<p class='c000'>A description of the Imhoff tank has been here included
since it represents an important development in sewage disposal
and helps to solve what has heretofore been one of the main
difficulties of sewage disposal, especially for cities and villages,
namely, the satisfactory and convenient disposition of sludge;
but it is not considered that their construction is advisable or
warranted where only a small quantity of sewage is to be treated,
and settling tanks to treat sewage contributed by less than, say,
two hundred persons would generally be constructed as previously
described.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>VALVES, SIPHONS, AND SIPHON CHAMBERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was explained in Chapter I that one of the essentials of
successful sewage purification is an intermittent application
of the sewage to the beds in which bacteria are to act. This
intermittent action is secured by providing a small additional
tank or by setting aside a part of the settling tank and by
installing therein some kind of mechanism for the purpose of
changing the more or less regular flow into an intermittent or
periodical flow. The proper capacity of this tank will be considered
later in the chapters dealing with the several methods
of final purification. Now it may be said only that the size
depends on the amount of sewage to be cared for per day and
on the size of the dose demanded by the purification method.
The size of dose depends directly upon the method of treatment
and on the size of the particles in the beds intended to receive
the sewage. On sand beds, for example, it is customary to
discharge the sewage from the dosing tank three times a day,
although many plants operate with a daily discharge. The size
of the dosing tank, however, in the latter case has to be three
times as large as in the former, and it is usually worth while to
take the additional trouble of having more frequent operation
in order to save the cost of the larger tank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The simplest method of construction of the dosing tank
is to make it a part of the sedimentation tank by means of a
cross wall, which latter must be strong enough to withstand
the pressure of the water on one side when the dosing tank is
empty. (See Figs. <a href='#fig2'>2</a> and <a href='#fig3'>3</a>.) There is no objection to this tank
being separate and some distance away from the sedimentation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>tank, and sometimes, for convenience in distributing the sewage
from the dosing tank onto several beds in turn, the dosing tank
is placed at the centre of a group of
beds with the settling tank outside.
If the dosing tank is a part of the
main tank, the sewage flows into it
over a dividing wall between the two
tanks or through a pipe laid through
this wall, while if the tank is separate
from the other, then a longer pipe
connection is required.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 10.</span>—Sludge Valve for Floor of Tank.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is economical to arrange that
the level of the sewage in the dosing
tank, at the time when that tank discharges,
shall be at the level of the
sewage in the settling tank, since then
no head is lost. It is better still to
arrange the mechanism in the dosing
tank so that the level of the sewage
there at the time of its discharge will
be from four to eight inches higher
than the normal level in the settling tank. The effect of
this is to back up the sewage and raise the general level in
the settling tank, and when the dosing tank discharges there
is drawn off not only the sewage in that tank, but also an
amount in the large settling tank equivalent to that which is
above the normal level of the sewage there. The advantage of
this is plain in that it reduces the necessary volume of the dosing
tank by that of the back water in the settling tank, and, while
it was thought at one time that such a frequent variation in
the level of the main tank might affect injuriously the scum
which forms there, and perhaps also the bacterial action going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>on in the tank, there seems to be no real reason why this
method may not be used with considerable advantage in
economy of construction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bottom of the dosing tank, which is preferably made
of concrete, should have a slope toward the point from which
the outlet pipe leads, thus enabling the outward rush of sewage
to carry off any material which would otherwise settle in the
bottom and perhaps decompose there.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 11.</span>—Sludge Valve for Side Wall of Tank.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The simplest method of operating the dosing tank is by
means of a hand valve fastened either to the floor of the chamber
or to the bottom of the outside wall. Fig. <a href='#fig10'>10</a> shows a simple
form of a valve suitable for the floor
and intended to be operated by a rod
extending up through the sewage
to the outside air. Such a valve
can be made at any local foundry,
the bearing surfaces turned up in
any machine shop, and a piece of
leather for packing purchased at any
hardware store. Such a design,
however, is not suitable for a large
valve or for a great depth of water,
since the pressure on the valve is dependent
on the weight of the column
of water acting on its area. If the
outlet pipe is six inches in diameter,
the diameter of the upper surface
of this valve would be about ten
inches, and the area of the top of the
valve would be about half a square foot, so that, with six feet
of water above, weighing 62½ pounds per square foot, the weight
on the valve to be lifted would be 186 pounds, rather more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>could be lifted by one man. Under such conditions it would be
necessary, using such a valve, to rig a lever, the fulcrum being
fastened to the edge of the tank, the
short end of the lever to the rod, and
the long end so arranged as to reduce
the load in the ratio of about one to
four. Fig. <a href='#fig11'>11</a> shows another type of
valve intended to be set into the side
of the tank with the floor sloping rapidly
toward the low point at which
this valve is set. These valves require
better workmanship and are preferably
purchased from one of the dealers
in valves who make this type as one
of their regular stock forms. Fig. <a href='#fig12'>12</a>
shows the design made by the Coffin
Valve Company, of Troy, N. Y., and
a similar form of valve is made by the
Caldwell-Wilcox Company, Newburg,
N. Y. For a
six-inch pipe, these
valves are so made that the danger of the
moving parts rusting together is avoided by
having one surface bronze or some similar noncorrosive
metal. Fig. <a href='#fig13'>13</a> shows an ordinary
gate valve generally used for water works, but
applicable to sewerage works. Such a valve
is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig5'>5</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig14'>14</a> shows a form made in England and
largely used as a cheap valve for the purpose
of emptying a tank rapidly. The peculiarity of the valve
is that a sidewise motion of the long handle locks the valve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>into position so that the moving part of the valve may be
readily set at any height. The one shown in the figure is taken
from the catalogue of the Adams
Hydraulic Company, Westminster,
London, and is listed in their catalogue
at $6.50 for a six-inch pipe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig15'>15</a> shows another type of
valve which is supplied by some
firms making sewer pipe and consists,
as may be seen, of a light
moving valve which is attached to
a projection cast on the top of the
vitrified tile pipe in such a way that
the valve comes to an even seat on
the bevelled end of the pipe. It is
found that with pressure acting
against the valve the thin metal of
which it is composed is pressed
against the pipe so that little, if any,
water or sewage will escape. The
valve can easily be opened by attaching
a cord or chain to the ring at the lower edge of the
valve, and when released the valve shuts automatically. This
is a very cheap and convenient design, and answers every
purpose for emptying tanks by hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>More elaborate structures of the same general type have
been made, using cast iron as the metal, the stationary collar
with the bevelled end being built into the masonry wall of the
tank. This type of flap valve is faced with bronze, and the
bearings or joints have bronze bushings. A satisfactory valve
of this sort can be made at a local foundry and machine shop,
but there is danger that the valve will not be water-tight. Fig. <a href='#fig16'>16</a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>shows such a valve with the metal seat which is intended to
be bolted into the masonry of the tank wall.</p>

from the catalogue of the Adams Hydraulic Company, and
noteworthy because of the loose-link connection at the upper
part of the valve, the object of this being to prevent the valve
closing at the upper part without, at the same time, closing at
the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the dosing tank is to work automatically and independently
of human agency, an arrangement which is always preferable,
there must be installed some mechanism which takes the
place of the valve operated by hand. This mechanism is in almost
every case a siphon which is put into action when the water level
reaches a certain height, and which discharges rapidly until the
water falls to a point when air is admitted to the inside of the
siphon pipe, thereby interrupting the flow.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is on the market a dosing apparatus which does not
involve a siphon, and which is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig18'>18</a>. This is made
by the Ansonia Manufacturing Company, 30 Church Street,
New York City, and its operation may be described as follows:
It consists of two floats connected by means of a chain which
passes over a wheel supported in the upper part of the chamber.
As the water in the chamber rises, the left-hand float shown
in the drawing rises and the right-hand float falls, thereby
communicating a rotary motion to the wheel. A projection on
this wheel at a certain point when the left-hand valve has
reached the desired height communicates with an inside portion
of the wheel, to which a chain connected with the valve is
attached. Thus the valve is opened at the right height, and
remains open until the water has fallen to the bottom of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>chamber. Then the left-hand float falls, and the apparatus
is ready to repeat the operation. This apparatus, for a small
installation, will probably cost, set up in place, about $15.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig19'>19</a> shows the simplest form of siphon arranged to discharge
water from a tank. It will be noticed that it consists of
an inverted bent pipe, one leg being longer than the other,
and extending into a pool of water formed in the end of the
discharge pipe. When the water level in the tank reaches the
bent portion of the siphon pipe, the water begins to flow out,
and will continue to flow until air is drawn in at the lower end
of the short leg. This stops the flow and the tank begins to
fill again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig20'>20</a> shows another method of working the siphon and
insuring its rapid initial action. This is known as the Van
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Vranken flush tank, and the feature of this arrangement is
the movable bucket, which in one position seals the lower
end of the longer leg. Then, however, the siphon begins to
act, and the bucket, which is hung on trunnions, is disturbed
and its contained water is dumped out. This allows the escape
of the water in the longer leg and insures a vigorous starting
up of the siphon into action.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more simple type, however, is the inverted siphon arrangement,
developed perhaps most completely by the Pacific Flush
Tank Company under the Miller patents. Fig. <a href='#fig21'>21</a> shows their
ordinary design, the upper part of the siphon being replaced by a
bell and the discharge starting when the level of the water in
the long leg of the siphon has been depressed sufficiently to
reach the curved part of the pipe. The principle on which this
siphon works is as follows:</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 19.</span>—Simplest form of Automatic Siphon.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When the water rises in the tank above the lower edge
of the bell, the air which remained between the water in the
siphon pipe and in the bottom of the tank is confined, and, as
the water rises, is gradually compressed. The effect of this
compression is to force down the water in the long leg of the
siphon and to hold down the level of the water inside the bell
lower than the level outside. When sufficient head of water
in the tank is secured, the water inside the pipe will be forced
down to the curved part of the pipe, and, the siphon being so
designed, the water level inside the bell will be just at the
top of the same pipe, but on the outside. Any slight additional
height then allows the contained and compressed air to escape
around the bend in the pipe, suddenly relieving the pressure
and allowing the water to enter the pipe from under the bell
readily. Thus the siphon starts and continues to flow until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the water level falls so that the air is drawn in under the bell.
That stops the action of the siphon and the tank fills again.
These siphons are generally sold in two pieces, the cast iron bell
and the curved pipe being the factory product. At the plant
they have to be set in place, generally bedded in concrete and
properly connected with the outlet pipe. For a small installation
a three-inch or four-inch siphon is ample, and will cost,
delivered, from $10 to $15, depending on the freight.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>done more simply by installing two ordinary siphons of the
Miller or similar type. If one of these siphons is filled half full
when the tank is empty, that siphon will discharge first because
of the amount of water already present in the U-shaped tube.
During the filling of the tank previous to its discharge, the
other siphon will partially fill, so that when the tank begins
to fill for the second time the second siphon is half full and the
first nearly empty. In this way alternate action is secured and
the discharge takes place as often as the tanks fill.</p>

siphon of the corresponding large siphon is filled with water,
and at the same time part of the water in the auxiliary siphon

the small siphon, it is blown out through the vent pipe, and,
the air following, the large siphon is started.</p>

form of a “U” tube, the longer leg containing an auxiliary
small air pipe, with a return bend at its lower end. When the
chamber starts to fill, this small pipe bend or seal is filled with
water, so that the rising water confines and compresses air in
both the large and small “U” pipes. In time, and at any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>desired height, determined by changing the relative lengths of
the parts of the small pipe siphon, the seal is broken and the
air escaping draws air enough from the large pipe to start it
in action. The method has an advantage in that it requires
no deep excavation, and the mechanism can be set after the
siphon chamber is built.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig25'>25</a> shows a method of securing the alternate discharge
of sewage by siphons whose action depends upon an air trap,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>each siphon being of the type shown in Fig. <a href='#fig24'>24</a>. The installation
of the figure is further complicated by the fact that it is arranged
to discharge sewage from the four contact beds as well as to
discharge sewage onto the beds. The compartments, and the
piping connected therewith, at the four corners operate to
admit the sewage from the central channel onto the four beds
in rotation. The four square wells between the corner wells
operate to empty those beds in turn into the pipe shown at the
centre of the drawing, the pipe leading to the nearest stream.
The operation may be described as follows: Sewage enters at
the top of the drawing, and from the inlet channel flows into
the siphon channels marked A. A<sub>1</sub> is ready to discharge if
bed No. 4 was the last one to fill, since, when that bed
filled, the small bell D<sub>4</sub> forced the siphon A<sub>1</sub> open. Sewage
therefore flows through siphon A<sub>1</sub> into bed No. 1. As the
sewage level rises in bed No. 1, the outlet siphon from bed No. 2,
G<sub>2</sub>, is locked by the air pipe from B<sub>1</sub> so that bed No. 2 will be
ready for the next dose. Also the air pipe from the bell H<sub>1</sub>
opens the siphon G<sub>4</sub>, and allows bed No. 4 to drain into the
outlet drain. Also bell D<sub>1</sub>, when bed No. 1 is full, opens the
siphon A<sub>2</sub> through the connecting air pipe so that bed No. 2
begins to fill as soon as bed No. 1 is full. And finally bell C<sub>1</sub>
locks the siphon A<sub>1</sub>, and stops further flow into bed No. 1. The
other beds operate in the same way in turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manufacturers of siphons are always glad to advise
prospective buyers of the proper arrangement of siphons and the
details of placing, with dimension sketches.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a summary, it may be pointed out that in any installation,
one of the three methods above described may be adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. A simple valve worked by hand may be adopted and the
alternate distribution of the sewage regulated by choice of the
several valves placed at the head of the several discharge pipes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>2. An automatic discharge mechanism may be installed which
will operate regularly and intermittently, but lacking any
automatic selection of the bed onto which the discharge is to
be made. These siphons will discharge as often as the tank fills,
but the particular valve must be opened in order that the discharge
may take place onto any one of the several beds.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. An apparatus may be installed which will both discharge
intermittently and will also automatically select different beds
in turn onto which the discharge shall take place. It may even
discharge onto contact beds and also empty those beds, entirely
automatically.</p>

<p class='c000'>Which of these mechanisms shall be selected depends upon
the amount of money available and on the value to be placed
on the freedom from constant care which an automatic installation
gives. Not that a sewage-disposal plant may be ignored
because an automatic mechanism has been installed. No
machine is infallible, and sewerage machinery may give out
or stop working just as that for any other purpose. But instead
of a daily routine of duties which may not be interrupted, by
means of automatic apparatus one may avoid everything except
casual inspections and periodic cleaning.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>SUB-SURFACE IRRIGATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The disposal of sewage by the method of sub-surface irrigation,
sometimes known as the Waring system, consists
in its distribution by means of open jointed tiling over a
comparatively large area of soil and at a depth of a few
inches beneath the ground surface. The sewage should first
be passed through settling tanks to remove as much as practicable
of the suspended matters contained in it, as explained
in the chapter on settling tanks. The partially clarified effluent
from the settling tank should then be collected in a dosing chamber,
or separate compartment of the settling tank, and discharged
intermittently, preferably by means of a siphon, into the sub-surface
irrigation system. This intermittency of discharge of
accumulated quantities of effluent is necessary for an even
distribution of the effluent throughout the entire system of
sub-surface tiling, and for a continuous and successful operation
of the system as a whole. It has been found necessary,
also, to alternate the discharge of effluent from the dosing or
siphon chamber over different portions of the irrigation area.
One siphon is all that is necessary to install in the siphon chamber
for sub-surface irrigation systems, and if the settling
tank has two compartments, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>, Chapter
II, the single siphon would be placed in the centre of the
chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principle involved in this method of sewage purification
is that of any general method of sewage reduction in whatever
form carried on, namely, its oxidation or nitrification. This
oxidation, or breaking down of the organic matter in the sewage,
is accomplished in this case, as in the case of intermittent sand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>filters, contact beds, and sprinkling filters, through the agency
of bacterial action.</p>

<p class='c000'>Householders have long been familiar with the fact that
although solids contained in sewage may have been discharged
for long periods of time into a cesspool, the latter, if located
in dry, porous soil, did not seem to become filled with the solid
residue. This is due to the liquefaction of the solid matter in
the sewage after its discharge into the cesspool, and to the
seepage and bacterial reduction of the liquid matter in the
surrounding soil. To replace the cesspool and eliminate the
insanitary conditions which, in most instances, result from its
use, other methods have been devised which utilize the agencies
of nature to the best advantage. Thus the sedimentation and,
in some cases, the liquefaction of the solid matters in sewage
are carried on in specially designed settling tanks which are
easily cleaned and which provide for greater efficiency in settling
out suspended matters than the cesspool. Similarly, the filtration
of liquids from cesspools through the soil is replaced by the
scientific method of sub-surface irrigation, which is much more
efficient in three distinct ways: (1) the limited seepage area
represented by the walls of the cesspool is increased many times
by distributing the effluent from the settling tank over a large
area of soil in a system of sub-surface tiling; (2) the bacterial
reduction is more effective, since it has been found that the
bacterial action necessary to purify sewage takes place in the
upper layers of the soil and is almost absent at depths of five feet
or more; (3) the soil is given an opportunity to rest and to dry
out by alternately using different portions of the sub-surface
irrigation system. In the cesspool the seepage of the effluent
and whatever bacterial action takes place in the surrounding
soil must go on continuously, which often results in clogging of
the soil and overflowing of the cesspool.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The purification and final disposition of sewage by means of
sub-surface irrigation is the method best adapted to the single
residence, and oftentimes to the hotel or institution, if soil
conditions are favorable and proper area is available. This
system requires less oversight in its operation than the various
forms of artificial filters. Furthermore, the sewage is entirely
hidden from sight after it leaves the settling tank, and this is
usually desirable near private residences and on the grounds of
country homes, country clubs, and summer hotels. Also,
where the sewage must be treated in close proximity to a residence
or hotel or at a point on the windward side of a residence,
this method, more effectually than any other, precludes the
possibility of a nuisance resulting from the operation carried on,
since the settling-tank effluent is at no point exposed directly
to the air. Furthermore, its cost is less than that of other works
for final treatment of sewage, and, finally, the system is more
easily installed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The method is in reality modified broad irrigation, but the
sub-surface irrigation field can be utilized much more effectively
and with considerably less attention than a broad irrigation
area, and, as noted above, is less liable to be the cause of a
nuisance or to be the means of spreading infectious disease
through the agencies of flies and other insects.</p>

<p class='c000'>If an area of sandy soil is available on which to locate the
sub-surface irrigation field, if the settling tank and siphon
chamber have been correctly built, and if the sub-surface tiling
system has been properly laid, the success of the system is well
assured. On the other hand, failure is certain if either broad
irrigation or sub-surface irrigation methods of sewage disposal
are attempted on stiff, impervious clay soils. Between the
ranges of porosity of soil represented by these limits there are
many soils in which sewage may be successfully disposed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>by sub-surface irrigation. A sandy or gravelly loam will, without
question, successfully care for sewage effluent when such
effluent is properly distributed by sub-surface tiling, and even
in a rather heavy soil the effluent from a settling tank may often
be disposed of satisfactorily by providing for a greater length of
sub-surface tiling per person served by the settling tank than that
which would suffice in the more porous soils. However, if the
soil is very heavy so that surface water does not readily seep
away, or if the ground-water level is within two or three feet
of the surface, this method is not suitable and some form of
filter, described in the succeeding chapter, should be used for
final treatment of sewage.</p>

<p class='c000'>When soil conditions and the area available are favorable
to this method and such a system is to be installed, the irrigation
area selected should be at the point where the ground-water
level is lowest, and this will generally be on a plateau or bench
at the head of a slope of ground. The relative elevation of the
ground surface should, of course, be low enough to insure
operating head or fall to operate the siphon in the chamber
adjoining the settling tank and to distribute the effluent by
gravity to the sub-surface tiling. If the soil is composed of loose
gravel, or lies over a limestone or shale formation, the location
of the irrigation area should be selected with a view to preventing
the contamination of any wells or springs which may exist on
the premises,—that is, the area should be on lower ground,
and as far removed from wells as is convenient.</p>

<p class='c000'>As will be explained later, the length of sub-surface tiling
necessary to receive a given quantity of sewage effluent should
vary, within certain limits, with the character and porosity of
the soil, thus requiring larger quantities of effluent to be delivered
from the siphon or dosing chamber in the case of the more
compact soils. Also the size of this chamber should be determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>with reference to the number of sections into which the
sub-surface tiling system is divided.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>The dimensions of siphon chambers to effectively deliver the
effluent in proper volumes to the sub-surface irrigation system
are given in the following tables, which indicate widths of siphon
chambers to agree in general with the widths of the settling
tanks to serve a given number of persons, as shown in Chapter II.
These tables of dimensions for siphon chambers provide for two
different capacities where the same number of persons are
served by the sewer, depending on the total lengths of sub-surface
tiling required, which in turn depend on the character
of the soil in which the sub-surface system is laid. The tables
provide for a division of the sub-surface tiling system into two
parts up to a system for 100 persons, and into three parts for
a greater number of persons. These tables also show the total
length of lateral distributing tiling in the sub-surface irrigation
system necessary to distribute over a sufficient area at the
irrigation field, in both sandy soils and in the heavier loams,
the various quantities of sewage to be treated in the different-sized
tanks and discharged from the siphon chambers. The tables
also indicate the diameter of the siphon and the discharging
depth of each siphon.</p>

<p class='c000'>As discussed in Chapter III, the siphon, in discharging,
may draw upon the upper 4 to 8 inches of sewage in the
settling tank without interfering with the efficiency of the
tank. The dimensions of siphon chambers for 75 or more persons
in Table II, and for 35 or more persons in Table III (see
page <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>), provide for such a draught upon the settling-tank contents
of from 4 to 8 inches when the siphon discharges. This will
decrease the cost of the plant somewhat and provide for a more
efficient form of siphon chamber. The last column in each table
provides for the proper height of dividing-wall between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>settling tank and siphon chamber to allow the drawing down
of the settling-tank contents as noted above.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The sub-surface irrigation or distributing system consists
of a main carrier or effluent sewer leading away from the siphon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>chamber to the irrigation field, of two or more branches
of this main carrier, and of parallel lines of lateral distributing
tiling extending at intervals of 4 to 6 feet from the branch
carriers, or, in some locations, from each side of the branch
carriers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The frontispiece shows the relation between the several
portions of a sub-surface irrigation system. The house sewer is
shown leading to the settling tank, and from the siphon chamber
adjoining the settling tank the main carrier or effluent sewer
is shown leading to a diverting manhole from which the effluent
is carried at each discharge of the siphon to the lateral lines of
sub-surface tiling by the two branch carriers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig26'>26</a> shows in plan and section a sub-surface irrigation
system. The section, which is drawn to a larger scale than the
plan, shows the settling tank and the adjoining siphon chamber.
From this siphon chamber the effluent sewer carries the discharge
from the siphon to the diverting manhole, at which point the
effluent is diverted to the different portions of the sub-surface
tiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Fig. <a href='#fig27'>27</a> is shown in plan the diverting manhole and a
small portion of the sub-surface tiling system together with a
section through the diverting manhole and one of the lines of
distributing tiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>The main carrier should be of vitrified tile sewer pipe with
cemented joints, and should always have two or more branches
at the irrigation field in order to allow the use of different portions
of the field in turn for three days or a week at a time,
thus allowing one of the portions of the field to be resting for
corresponding periods. The branch carriers should be of vitrified
tile also, and should have cemented joints. If the diameter
of the siphon is 5 inches, the main carrier should be of 8–inch
vitrified tile with a fall of at least 6 inches per 100 feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>in order to quickly carry the dose from the siphon chamber to
the several lines of sub-surface tiling forming the distributing
system. With 3–inch siphons, a 6–inch main carrier may
be used, but the gradient or fall of the main carrier should
then be at least 12 inches per 100 feet, owing to the smaller
capacity of the 6–inch pipe. In placing the siphon in position,
when the siphon chamber is being
built, care should be taken to see that
the trap or U-shaped pipe is set plumb
or in a vertical position. Concrete
should then be placed around the siphon
to hold it in proper position and at the proper height, and
the trap should be filled with water before the bell is placed
in position. The bell should then be placed in position over the
long leg of the trap to prevent the materials used in construction
from being dropped into the siphon. The siphon should be
set so that the lower edge of the bell, or of that portion of
the bell under which the effluent is to flow, is three inches
above the floor of the siphon chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>In laying the distributing system, every second or third
length of the branch carriers, according
to the porosity of the soil and the spacing

should consist of a Y-branch (see Fig.

tiling are to be laid at right angles to the main carriers, as
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig27'>27</a>; or the lateral tiling may be fitted directly to
the Y-branch if the lateral lines are to be led away from the
carrier at an angle of 45°, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig30'>30</a>. The Y should
branch from the lower portion of the pipe, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig28'>28</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lateral tiling should be of three-inch agricultural tile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>(see Fig. <a href='#fig31'>31</a>), laid with a space of one-quarter inch between each
length and with a piece of tar paper or a half-collar of larger
diameter pipe, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig32'>32</a>, placed over the joints to
prevent clogging of the pipe with earth. In the heavier soils the
lateral lines of sub-surface tiling are sometimes set in trenches
eight to fourteen inches deep and about twelve inches wide,
filled with broken stone or gravel placed around the tiling to
within two or three inches of the ground surface, as shown in
Fig. <a href='#fig32'>32</a>. This allows the effluent to seep away more readily, but
while of advantage in those soils the provision is not necessary
in the more porous soils.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 31.</span>—Photograph of Tile laid as if for Sewage Disposal.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is generally found that a sufficient length of sub-surface
tiling should be laid to provide for not more than one to three
gallons of effluent per day for each linear foot of tiling. In
sandy soils there should be at least thirty to forty feet of tiling
for each person served by the sewer, with six feet of space
between the lines of tiling. This length per person should
be increased up to seventy or eighty feet for the more compact
sandy or gravelly loams, or the lighter clay loams, with the
lateral tiling spaced four feet apart. It is not considered feasible
to attempt to dispose of sewage by sub-surface irrigation in
soils which will not care for effluent when the greater lengths
of tiling per person, as stated above, will not prevent the appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of effluent on the surface. If, however, after the installation
of a sub-surface system in a rather heavy soil, it is found
that proper seepage of the effluent does not occur, the lateral
branches may sometimes be lengthened and the system then
found to operate satisfactorily.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 32.</span>—Sub-surface Tiling with Broken Stone or Gravel Surrounding Pipe.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The lines of lateral tiling should be laid with the invert, or
bottom of the pipe, inside, from six inches to one foot below the
surface, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig27'>27</a>. They should be parallel with the
contours or at right angles with the slope of the field, and should
have a gradient or fall of one-sixteenth of an inch to the foot
when laid in sandy soil or sandy loam, and of not more than
one thirty-second of an inch to the foot when laid in the heavier
loams. To obtain such gradients for the sub-surface tiling it is
sometimes necessary to lay out the trenches along irregular or
curved lines, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig33'>33</a>. The tiling should be laid
near the surface, as stated, and never deeper than twelve inches.
The temperature of the sewage will prevent its freezing even in
very severe winter weather, especially when the ground is
covered with snow.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>To provide for diverting the flow from the siphon chamber
first into one of the two portions into which the sub-surface system
is divided, and then, after an interval of three days or a
week, into the other portion of the system, at the point where
the main carrier is to branch, a ten-inch iron pipe casting (see
Fig. <a href='#fig34'>34</a>), with its lower portion forming the body of a double Y-branch
of six-inch or eight-inch pipe, may be placed, having a
swinging blade or gate attached inside in a vertical position.
When, for example, the effluent has been passed for a week
into section B of the sub-surface system, the gate <em>C</em>, shown in
Fig. <a href='#fig34'>34</a>, may be swung to the dotted position and the effluent,
at each discharge of the siphon chamber, will then pass through
the branch carrier <em>A</em> to section A of the sub-surface system;
or a double Y-branch of iron pipe (see Fig. <a href='#fig35'>35</a>) or a cross may be
placed at this point on the main carrier when there are to be
three sections of the sub-surface system, and valves may be
placed on the three branches of the main carrier thus formed
to permit of alternately shutting off the flow to the various
sections of the sub-surface tiling system (see also Fig. <a href='#fig30'>30</a>).
Perhaps the simplest and most serviceable device, however,
for alternately resting different portions of the irrigation field
is a diverting manhole with stop planks or wooden sluices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>sliding in grooves in the concrete walls or in a wooden frame,
as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig27'>27</a>. (See also Fig. <a href='#fig43'>43</a>, Chapter V.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the ground-water level is not very deep below the
surface, or a clay or hardpan stratum occurs at a depth of a few
feet, it is advisable to underdrain the irrigation field by lines
of open-jointed tiling laid at right angles to the lateral distributing
tiling and spaced about fifteen feet apart. (See Fig. <a href='#fig36'>36</a>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>These underdrains should be placed at least four feet below
the surface, and inspection pipes should be placed over the outlets
of the underdrains or at the points where they discharge into a
main underdrain, in order to afford opportunity to determine if
all portions of the irrigation field are properly caring for the
effluent. To provide for the placing of the inspection pipes,
a length of vitrified tile with a Tee may be placed on each line
of underdrain tiling near its junction with the main underdrain.
On this Tee, two or three lengths of vitrified tile may be set,
reaching to the ground surface and provided with a removable
wooden cover or a vitrified tile cap. This provision for inspection
is necessary where underdrains must be laid and where
the pollution of a stream is to be prevented, since it is often
found that through the activities of burrowing animals direct
outlets from the distributing tiling to the underdrains are formed
and the final effluent is therefore not sufficiently purified by
seepage through the soil. It is desirable for this reason to
omit the underdrains when possible, and in some instances a
blind ditch may be constructed around two or three sides of
the field in order to intercept the ground-water flow and to
lower the ground-water level at the field, thus better insuring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>proper seepage of the effluent distributed by the sub-surface
tiling.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The essential features of the sub-surface irrigation system
of sewage disposal have been outlined above, and it may be said
that this method is especially adapted to the residence or single
house. The method may be employed with success to dispose
of sewage from country clubs and summer hotels, provided the
soil conditions are favorable and proper areas may be utilized.
In these cases the comparatively short period during each year
in which the system is in use and the resulting long periods
of rest give opportunity for a recuperation of the soil and permit
the use of this system in comparatively large installations
where, under continuous operation, a different method of disposal
would be indicated. It should be borne in mind, however,
that when any doubt arises as to the suitability of the soil
to care for sewage by this method, and especially where considerable
expense would be involved in the installation of the
system, competent engineering advice should be sought by
property owners before the installation is undertaken. In fact,
it is advisable in the case of all large plants of this type to employ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the services of a sanitary engineer to lay out the system, since
the matter of accurate gradients and proper operating arrangements
then becomes very essential to the success of the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>While it is not generally advisable to arrange for the disposal
of sewage by sub-surface irrigation when the number of
persons served by the sewer exceeds two hundred, this method
will be found a most satisfactory one if the general conditions
at any point are favorable to its use as heretofore described,
and in such cases the adoption of this system is strongly recommended
to the owners of residences, summer camps, summer
hotels and boarding-houses, and to the managers of moderate-sized
institutions and of country clubs who must meet the
problem of properly disposing of sewage on their own premises.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>It has been shown that the selection of the type of plant best
suited to solve the sewage-disposal problem at any given place
depends on several factors and can be safely made only after
a consideration and study of such local conditions as the character
of the soil, the area available, the presence and nearness
to the surface of ground water, and the local topographical
conditions. If sub-surface irrigation is not feasible, when, for
instance, the soil is nearly impervious to water or when, in
the case of a wet soil, adequate underdrainage is not possible,
some form of artificial filter must be constructed to complete
the reduction of the sewage where the effluent from the settling
tank may not properly be discharged directly into a stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>If such a filter is to be constructed, the kind most suitable
depends, in turn, upon several factors, such as the degree of purification
to be attained, the suitability of the available areas
or locations for the different types of filters, the operating
head or fall available, and the relative cost of the sand, gravel,
broken stone, or furnace slag which may be used as material
for the filter bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the degree of purification of sewage that is
desired it may be said that, of the three general methods of
sewage purification, namely, intermittent sand filtration, treatment
in contact beds, and filtration through sprinkling or
trickling filters, the first method produces the most highly
purified effluent. Such an effluent, if from a properly constructed
and operated sand filter, may generally be considered
sufficiently purified to allow its discharge into a stream, even if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the stream is subsequently used as a source of potable water
supply. In some instances, however, subsequent sterilization
or disinfection of the effluent may be required, particularly if
the waterworks intake is relatively near the point of discharge
from the sewage filter, or if the flow of the stream is small in
comparison with the sewage flow. However, if a stream used
as a source of potable water supply receives the effluent from
a properly operated sand filter, the further safeguarding of the
quality of the water should generally be accomplished by
filtration or sterilization of the water supply, or both.</p>

<p class='c000'>In many cases the local conditions are such that contact
beds or sprinkling filters may be constructed more easily or
more economically than sand filters and, at the same time, the
lesser efficiency of the contact bed or the sprinkling filter, owing
to the fact that the stream is not used for water supply, may
not preclude the adoption of these latter types of plants.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, where natural deposits of sand of not too finely
divided particles occur or where such sand may be readily procured,
intermittent sand filters are most satisfactory for the
final treatment of sewage.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Intermittent Sand Filters</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>The agencies employed in purifying sewage by intermittent
sand filtration involve its oxidation, or nitrification by bacterial
action, while the mechanical straining effected by its passage
through the sand plays a very small part in its reduction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where natural deposits of sand of suitable quality occur,
sand filters are constructed by levelling off definite areas of
sand and making embankments eighteen inches high to enclose
these areas, the embankments being generally formed of the
surface loam and subsoil which must usually be removed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>order to expose the sand layer. There should be from three to
five beds prepared in order to provide for alternating the discharge
of the effluent from the settling tank over different
portions of the filtration area and thus to provide resting periods
for each bed while in operation. Also, the preparation of several
equal areas permits discontinuing the use of any single area
for several days or a week at a time in order to allow it to dry
out and permanently retain its filtering capacity. In Fig. <a href='#fig37'>37</a>
is shown a view of a set of sand-filter beds arranged in terraces
on sloping ground, the embankments being formed by the
material excavated to uncover the natural sand layer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proper number of beds and the area of each bed corresponding
to the number of persons to be served by the sewer
are given in Table IV. This table also gives the required dimensions
of siphon chambers (assuming that this chamber forms
a separate compartment of the settling tank) for the capacities
necessary in order that the effluent may be distributed in proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>quantities over each bed or over each pair of beds, as in the
case of plants serving two hundred or more persons. The
widths of siphon chambers given correspond in general with
the widths of settling tanks given in Table I. As in Table III,
the dimensions of siphon chambers given are based on a drawing
down of the effluent in the tank when the siphons discharge,
amounting to from four to eight inches. The last column in
the table gives the space which should be left between the roof
of the tank and the top of the dividing wall between the settling
tank and the siphon chamber to provide for this draught upon
the settling-tank contents. It will be seen that no draught
upon the contents of the settling tank when the siphons discharge
is arranged for in the case of tanks serving from four to
twenty-five persons.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to quickly convey the dose from the siphon chamber
to the filter beds at the rate at which the siphon discharges,
the sewer from the siphon chamber should be of proper size
and should have a sufficient gradient. For instance, with a
3–inch siphon the sewer should be 6 inches in diameter, with a
gradient or fall of at least 12 inches per 100 feet; with a 5–inch
siphon, the sewer should be 8 inches in diameter, with a gradient
of at least 6 inches in 100 feet; with a 6–inch siphon, the diameter
of the sewer should be 8 inches, and should have a gradient of
at least 12 inches per 100 feet, or 10 inches with a gradient of
at least 3 inches per 100 feet; with an 8–inch siphon, 12 inches,
with a gradient of at least 12 inches per 100 feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sewage is sometimes applied directly to the beds without
treatment in settling tanks, generally, in such cases, after having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>been screened to remove the larger suspended matters, but it is
decidedly preferable in the case of the smaller plants under
discussion to pass the sewage first through settling tanks, as in
the method of sub-surface irrigation. Therefore, the areas of
beds given in the table are for sewage which has been passed
through settling tanks. It is even necessary, in the case of
sand filters for institutions where considerable grease and soaps
are contained in the sewage, to provide grease traps through
which the sewage must pass before it reaches the settling tank.
The effluent from the tank should be discharged intermittently
by means of a dosing chamber and siphon and should
be distributed quickly over the surface of the bed as uniformly
as possible. This is generally accomplished in the case of
the larger beds by laying on the surface of the bed, wooden
troughs, with short branches, as shown in Figs. <a href='#fig38'>38</a> and <a href='#fig39'>39</a>.
A detail of a portion of these distributing troughs is given in
Fig. <a href='#fig40'>40</a>. This view shows the hinged gates which are used
to effect a proportionate division of the flow of the various
branches of the main trough. The view also shows the slots
in the sides of the troughs which allow the sewage to flow out
onto the bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where sand deposits do not occur at a point suitable for
the location of the disposal plant, but where sand may be procured
at a reasonable cost, the beds may be formed artificially
similar to the natural sand beds heretofore described, but should
not be less than three feet deep. It is generally necessary in the
case of artificially constructed sand filters to provide underdrains
as described below.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two views of such an artificial sand filter are shown by

In this drawing are shown the sewer leading from the house, the

siphons, the effluent sewers, and the diverting manhole, from
which three pipe lines convey the sewage to the filter beds.

<p class='c000'>Where sand must be carted in to form the filters, the embankments
to retain the sand should generally be formed by excavating
for a depth of two feet the whole area upon which the beds
are to be placed. The material thus excavated will usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>be sufficient to form the embankments. The embankments
should usually be at least two feet wide on top and should have
side slopes of one and a half to one; that is, the bottom width
of the embankment should be two feet plus three times the
height. In clay soils the pits for the filter beds may be excavated
with the sides vertical, or nearly so. The bottom of each bed,
as it is prepared for the placing of the sand which is to compose
the filter, should slope slightly from the sides toward the centre
line of the bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where the character of the underlying strata of soil or the

surface, with branches each way at intervals of about fifteen feet.
The main underdrain should be six inches in diameter, of agricultural
tile or of vitrified sewer pipe, laid with open joints,
and should have a fall of at least six inches per hundred feet.
The branches may be of three-inch agricultural tile.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In large installations for cities and villages it is usual to
install either plural alternating siphons or apparatus known
as sewage feeds, by means of which the contents of the dosing
chamber are discharged upon the different beds in rotation,
there generally being four or five beds constructed in each unit.
This requires a separate siphon or sewage feed for each bed, and
entails considerable expense. However, for smaller plants such
as are now being considered, two ordinary siphons may be
placed in the same dosing chamber as described in Chapter III,
and so primed as to discharge alternately. Then, by means
of a diverting manhole or chamber through which the dose must
pass, the effluent may be diverted onto two beds in rotation,
allowing a third bed to rest, or, if there are five beds, it may
be diverted onto two pairs of beds in rotation, allowing a fifth
bed to rest. For instance, in the case of five beds, a diverting
manhole may be constructed as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig45'>45</a>, and arrangements
may be made to couple bed No. 3 with No. 2 or No. 4,
allowing bed No. 1 or No. 5 to rest by means of the stop-plank
to cut off the flow to either of these beds, as shown in the illustration.
Then, when bed No. 3 is to be rested, stop-planks <em>A</em>
and <em>B</em> are both closed, and the stop-planks against all pipe
outlets are raised. If it is desired to throw bed No. 1 out of
use, the stop-plank is placed against the end of the pipe leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to this bed, stop-plank A is raised, and stop-plank <em>B</em> is
lowered. One siphon will then discharge onto beds Nos. 4
and 5, and with the next filling of the siphon chamber the
second siphon will discharge onto beds Nos. 2 and 3. By a
proper combination of the stop-plank positions, any two sets
of two beds each may receive alternately the discharge from
the siphon chamber while the remaining single bed may be left
resting. The method for operating the beds in rotation described
above may, of course, be easily applied when only three beds
are constructed. A provision for allowing one bed to be thrown
out of use for a week or so at a time is very necessary for the
reasons stated above.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>At intervals of several weeks it will be found necessary to
break up the surface of each bed by raking or else to remove
a thin coating of clogging material. This should be done after
the bed has been rested and dried out, when the surface matting
may be taken off without removing much sand. To provide
for operating the beds in winter, in the late fall, before the ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>has frozen, ridges and furrows should be formed on the surface
of the beds, similar to those shown in Fig. <a href='#fig51'>51</a>. The furrows
should be two or three feet apart and eight to twelve inches
deep. Then when effluent is discharged onto the beds in freezing
weather, as it fills the furrows, an ice roof will gradually form,
spanning the furrows and protecting the sides and bottoms
of the furrows from freezing, especially if a snowfall occurs
before severe weather sets in. It will sometimes be found
necessary, especially with small beds that are well underdrained,
to provide board coverings for the furrows to take the place of
the natural ice roofs.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The effluent from the tank should be discharged in such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>quantities as to flood the entire bed to a depth of from one to
two inches, except that some of this effluent will immediately
begin to seep into the bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Respecting the quality and relative fineness of sand suitable
for sewage filters, it should be noted that certain empirical
methods of measurement have been developed for use in comparing
the size and uniformity of particles of various sands.
These measures are (1) the “effective size,” and (2) the “uniformity
coefficient.” The “effective size” is the size of sand
particle expressed in millimetres compared to which ten per
cent by weight of the particles in the sample is finer. The
“uniformity coefficient” is the ratio of the size of grain which
has sixty per cent of the sample finer than itself to the size
which has ten per cent finer than itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning the grades of sand through which sewage may
be successfully and properly treated by intermittent filtration,
it has been found that the “effective size” should not be less
than .20 of a millimetre, nor greater than .50 of a millimetre,
and the “uniformity coefficient” should generally be from 1.5
to 3.0, when sewage is applied at the usual rate. If, however,
the sand is clean and sharp, but has an “effective size” somewhat
smaller than the limit above stated, it may sometimes
be found suitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of any sewage-disposal project of considerable
magnitude, where any doubt exists as to the suitability of the
sand available for use in sand filters, analyses of representative
samples of the sand should be arranged for, and competent
engineering advice should be sought before any large outlay is
incurred. In general, however, it may be said that any clean,
sharp sand suitable for building use is suitable for sand-filter
beds in any situation. Obviously, the coarseness of the sand
plays no part in its suitability as a filtering medium if the sand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>occurs in a natural bed and underdrains are not necessary,
since no question of the discharging of an unpurified effluent
would ordinarily arise in such cases.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Contact Beds</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>The treatment of sewage in contact beds consists in distributing
the effluent from settling tanks over beds of broken
stone, furnace slag, or other similar material contained in
water-tight compartments and allowing the beds to fill so that
the spaces between the filtering material will be filled with
the sewage effluent. These beds are so arranged that the effluent
is held in contact with the filtering material for a fixed interval
of time and then, usually by means of special siphons called
“timed siphons,” or other automatic devices, it is discharged
from the beds onto sand filters for further treatment, or into
streams, as the case may be.</p>

<p class='c000'>The process involves, as in intermittent sand filtration,
the nitrifying or oxidizing agencies of bacterial action, and
differs from intermittent filtration and from treatment of sewage
on sprinkling filters principally in the fact that the flow of
effluent through the beds is arrested and the liquid sewage held
in contact with the filtering material, as noted above.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much smaller areas of filter beds are required than in the
case of sand filters, and for this reason this form of filter will
often be found preferable. The conditions which result in its
selection are usually either the unsuitable character of the soil
or the presence of ground water, making the installation of sub-surface
irrigation systems impracticable; or the absence of sand
deposits or the high cost in any locality of sand suitable for
sand-filtration beds, making their construction difficult or
expensive.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>The walls and floor of a contact bed are generally constructed
of concrete, and the filter should be rectangular in form, as it
is easier to distribute the effluent uniformly over a bed of this
shape. The details given in Chapter II for constructing the
walls and floors of settling tanks will serve as a general guide
in the construction of contact beds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The real work of the contact filter is carried on during the
period of “resting empty,” that is, after the effluent has been
withdrawn from the bed. While the effluent fills the beds, much
of the suspended solid matter, together with a large proportion
of the bacteria contained in the sewage, adheres to a gelatinous
film which has formed on the surfaces of the stones or other
materials forming the beds. This interval of “resting full”
should usually be about two hours. Then, when the liquid
portion is withdrawn from the bed, air is drawn in between the
stones, enabling the nitrifying or aërobic bacteria to do their
work of breaking down both the suspended and the partially
dissolved organic matters which have been contained in the
sewage and which have adhered to the filter material. It is
believed, that some oxidation of that portion of the organic
matter which is in true solution is also accomplished when
the effluent passes over the gelatinous covering of the
stones by reason of the oxygen which has been absorbed by
this covering.</p>

<p class='c000'>The interval when the bed is “resting empty” should be considerably
longer than the combined intervals when the bed is
filling, “resting full,” and emptying. For this reason there
should be a series of from three to five beds in order that it
will not be necessary to turn the effluent from the settling tank
continuously onto one bed, which would result in the clogging
of this bed with suspended matters. The additional third (or
fifth) bed also gives opportunity for allowing each bed in turn
to be thrown out of use for intervals of a week or so at a time,
which is also necessary to keep the beds up to their proper
efficiency and obviate the necessity of cleaning or renewing the
filter material oftener than once in seven or eight years.</p>

<p>PLAN OF SEWAGE DISPOSAL WORKS<br />FOR<br />MR. CHARLES L. A. WHITNEY<br />ALBANY, N.Y.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>In Fig. <a href='#fig46'>46</a> is shown in plan and section a sewage-disposal
plant for the residence of Mr. Charles L. A. Whitney, of Albany,
N. Y., consisting of a settling tank, dosing chamber, and contact
beds. This plant is designed to serve twenty-five persons,
although the settling tanks have a capacity for double the
amount of sewage on the usual basis of design.</p>

<p class='c000'>The depth of filtering material in the beds should preferably
be four or five feet, although, where operating head or fall is
limited, this depth may be decreased to three feet. The floor
of the bed should slope toward the outlet end at a rate of about
one-eighth of an inch per foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Various materials are used to form the body of the filter,
such as broken stone, coke, broken brick, and furnace slag,
but the material used should not be such as will disintegrate
readily, and for this reason broken limestone, from one-half
inch to one and one-half inches in size, with perhaps two-inch
stones for the bottom six inches of the bed surrounding the
underdrains, is most suitable for small plants.</p>

<p class='c000'>These underdrains should be constructed of horse-shoe
tiling, and in the case of beds more than eight or ten feet wide
should preferably be laid with short branches reaching from a
main drain laid along the centre of the floor of the bed;
or these drains may be laid in parallel lines, as shown in
Fig. <a href='#fig46'>46</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to alternate the discharge of effluent from the
settling tank onto different beds in turn and to provide for more
uniformly distributing the effluent over all portions of the bed,
the settling-tank effluent should be collected as in the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>methods of disposal described, in a siphon or dosing chamber,
from which, by means of alternating siphons, it may be delivered
to the proper bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of a group of three beds or five beds, diverting
chambers with stop-planks, similar to those described in connection
with intermittent sand filters, may be provided to allow
the throwing out of use of each of the beds in turn for a week
or so at a time. In the smaller plants accommodating up to
one hundred and fifty persons, it is hardly necessary to provide
for more than three beds, thus allowing opportunity for each
one to rest for one week in every three to six weeks, which will
result in a temporary increase of fifty per cent in the rate of
application of effluent to the remaining beds. In the case
of the larger plants, especially if they are to be operated continuously,
it is better to construct five beds so that two pairs
of two beds each may be used alternately, leaving one bed, or
twenty per cent of the total area, out of use. This will result
in an increase of but twenty-five per cent in the rate of
application of effluent to the four beds in use.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the usual rates of operation for contact beds, one filling
per day of the beds will result, and, if the dosing of the beds is
carried on as above and as described in the portion of this
chapter dealing with the dosing of intermittent sand filters,
but two siphons in the dosing tank, constituting double alternating
siphons, will be necessary. Such an arrangement will
eliminate the necessity of installing plural alternating siphons
consisting of three or more siphons, the cost of which is not
warranted in connection with small plants, since the double
alternating siphons will insure proper operation of the beds at
much less cost. Of course, in the larger plants where two beds
are dosed at each discharge of a siphon, a larger siphon chamber
is necessary with the two siphons, but the extra cost of a larger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>siphon chamber would in most cases be more than offset by
the increased cost of plural alternating siphons.</p>

<p class='c000'>The main effluent carrier from the siphon chamber to each
contact bed should discharge into a half-tile carrier, with
branches, laid on the surface of the contact bed, as shown in
Fig. <a href='#fig46'>46</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each contact bed should be provided at the outlet end with
a “timed” siphon set in a separate chamber of two compartments,
as shown in the drawing. The diameter of the timed
siphons should generally be that of the next larger size than that
indicated for the dosing-chamber siphons. As shown in the
illustration, where only three beds are necessary, the third timed
siphon may be dispensed with if arrangements are made to
permit the use of one siphon for discharging either the middle
or the outside bed on that side, and to permit the use of the
other siphon for discharging either the middle bed or the bed
on the other side. In such installations gates or valves must
be placed on the outlets of the contact beds to prevent the filling
of the bed that is out of use by back flow from the timed siphon
chamber used to discharge the adjacent bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of contact beds is considerably greater than the
cost of intermittent sand filters, especially when sand of proper
quality is available, but their construction is advised in many
cases where sub-surface irrigation is not feasible, where the
premises are subject to overflow or the ground-water level is
high, and where it is not practicable to construct sand filters.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following table are given the proper number of units
or beds for contact filters of different-sized installations, together
with the required area of each filter, the depth of the filter
medium in all beds being four feet. The table also shows the
dimensions of the siphon chamber adjacent to the settling tank
and the diameter of the siphons necessary to discharge the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>effluent in proper volumes onto each contact bed, or each pair
of contact beds. Where it is necessary to decrease the depth
of the contact beds to three and one-half or three feet, owing
to lack of operating head or fall, a proportionate increase should
be made in the area of each bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the above table, as in the previous tables, in indicating
the height to which the dividing wall between the settling tank
and siphon chamber should be carried, allowance is made for a
draught upon the contents of the settling tank at each discharge
of a siphon of from four to eight inches. In the discussion
relating to siphon chambers in connection with the description
of intermittent sand filters will be found the necessary details as
to the discharging depths of siphons of different diameters and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the necessary depths of the siphon chambers in which such
siphons are to be placed. The construction of contact beds will
naturally be approached with hesitancy by property owners
and others not familiar with such work, and it is strongly recommended
that where it is possible the services of a sanitary
engineer be engaged to design and supervise the construction
of a plant involving any considerable outlay, unless it is felt
that the descriptions and directions given above have afforded
a clear understanding of the design and construction of this
type of sewage-disposal works.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Sprinkling Filters</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>One of the more recently developed methods of sewage
disposal,—the sprinkling- or trickling-filter system,—has for
its principal feature the thorough aëration of the settling-tank
effluent before its passage through the filter. This filter, like
the contact filter, is of the rapid, coarse-grained type, but in its
operation resembles the process of intermittent sand filtration
in that the sewage effluent passes through the filter continuously
without being held in contact with the filtering
material as in the contact bed. The aëration of the sewage
effluent, which very greatly aids the final process of nitrification
or oxidation in the filter, is accomplished by spraying the sewage
effluent over the surface of the beds through a series of riser
pipes with nozzles, or allowing it to fall in fine streams on dash
plates which cause it to sprinkle over the beds and thus to
absorb oxygen from the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sprinkling filters produce an effluent with a considerably
less degree of purification than sand filters, but may in general
be said to produce a more stable effluent, that is, one less liable
to subsequent putrefaction than the effluent from contact beds.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Furthermore, with the usual depths of contact beds and sprinkling
filters, an area approximately four times greater is required
to treat the same amount of sewage on contact beds than is
necessary if sprinkling filters are constructed. However, since
the effluent from sprinkling filters is much more turbid, necessitating,
in most cases, subsequent sedimentation before discharge;
since considerably greater operating head or fall is
necessary; and since their operation requires much more supervision,
the construction of sprinkling filters is not generally
as advisable as contact beds for small installations, especially
in cold climates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The construction of sprinkling filters as compared to contact
filters differs principally in the size and depth of filtering material,
in the means provided for distributing the effluent over the
beds, and in the arrangements for draining the filter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The depth of filtering material in a sprinkling filter is usually
from five to ten feet, preferably not less than eight feet. The
material for the filter is the same as that used for contact filters
but the fragments should be from one to three inches in diameter.
Instead of a system of tile underdrains on the floor of the filter,
a false floor of perforated tile, rectangular in section, or of half
tile, circular in section, with drainage holes cut out along the
sides, should be laid over the entire floor of the filter. As the
settling-tank effluent is sprayed on the filter it passes downward
between the spaces of the filtering material, and reaching
the floor of the filter is collected in a main drainage channel,
through which it passes to the outfall sewer, and thence to the
final settling tank or into the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>As with contact beds and sand filters, intermittency of
application of the effluent to the filter is essential for proper
action of the filter, and this is accomplished as in the other
types of filters by means of automatic siphons placed in dosing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>tanks. These tanks, however, are of special design in the case
of sprinkling filters. Each siphon discharges into a main carrier
of iron pipe which extends sometimes over the surface of the
filter, but generally along the floor of the filter. The main carrier
has branch pipes of smaller diameter extending at right angles
nearly to the sides of the filter. On these branches vertical
riser pipes spaced about ten feet apart are connected, and these
riser pipes extend a few inches above the surface of the filter.
Nozzles are fitted to the ends of the riser pipes by means of
which the sewage effluent, under pressure, is sprinkled, at short
intervals, in the form of a fine, umbrella-shaped spray, over the
surface of the filter. This results in a thorough aëration of the
effluent before it reaches the filtering material, and makes this
form of filter very effective.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In Fig. <a href='#fig47'>47</a> is shown a view of a sprinkling filter at Danville,
Pa., operating when the temperature was 14° below zero. It is
generally believed, however, that in cold climates it is advisable
to house small sprinkling filters.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Owing to the rather complicated hydraulic features and the
somewhat difficult engineering principles involved in the construction
and operation of sprinkling or trickling filters, it is
not deemed advisable to attempt to describe them in sufficient
detail to furnish directions for their construction. The design
of a sprinkling-filter system for small as well as for large installations
should always be entrusted to an engineer conversant
with this line of sanitary engineering. It is believed, however,
that the description of such filters given above will aid those
who are about to install sewage-disposal plants in the selection
of the type of plant best suited to their particular needs and
conforming to the conditions peculiar to their situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Summarizing the foregoing descriptions and directions with
reference to sewage filters, it may be stated that where natural
facilities for disposing of sewage by simpler methods do not
exist, the construction of a sewage filter of some one of the
above described types offers a solution of every problem thus
encountered. It is well to repeat that sub-surface irrigation,
where feasible, should be adopted, and this will be the method
indicated in a large majority of cases where small disposal
plants are to be constructed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal point to be remembered in connection with
sewage filters is that their construction is but a good beginning,
and that their proper operation is very necessary to the success
of the undertaking. They constitute, with the developed
bacteria in the filter, a rather sensitive mechanism capable of
efficient work if properly handled, but each filter unit must
be carefully operated and must be regularly given extended
periods of rest for the restoration of the void or open-space
capacity of the filter, and to provide for the necessary aëration
of the filtering material.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peculiar action which takes place in a filter in the reduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>of sewage, and which is not even yet fully known, is best
evidenced by the fact that sewage filters, especially of the
coarse-grained type, do not attain their highest efficiency until
after several weeks or months of operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a knowledge of these points, it will be seen that there
should be little divergence from accepted standards in the
construction and operation of sewage filters if they are to prove
satisfactory when installed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>For many years it has seemed to thoughtful persons that
permitting sewage, either from single houses or from larger
communities, to be turned into streams was a mistaken policy
because of the waste of manurial elements involved. It has long
been understood that, in order to maintain the fertility of the
soil, a constant application of fertilizers was necessary, and,
while undoubtedly many farms are managed without any such
repeated applications, the more scientific and modern farmer
believes to-day that the frequent and abundant use of fertilizer
is the foundation of his success.</p>

<p class='c000'>In ordinary sewage there exists a certain amount of fertilizing
elements. Two prominent English chemists, not many years
ago, proved by their analyses that in ordinary sewage there
existed the essential elements of a good fertilizer to the value of
$2 per year for each person contributing to that sewage.
Other chemists, working at the problem in other ways, have
reached about the same result, and there can be little doubt
of their accuracy if the fertilizing elements alone are considered.
In applying these figures to the sewage of a city the difficulty
has always been that the fertilizing elements have been so
thoroughly covered up with the large volume of water present
in the sewage that it has been practically impossible to separate
them from the water. Thus, in a city of 100,000 persons, the
fertilizer in the sewage might, indeed, be worth $200,000, but
to realize this amount it must be separated from the 10,000,000
gallons of water—a task which is so tremendous, if not impossible,
as to make the value of the fertilizer of no account. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>those parts of the country where the water itself has a value,
as in the irrigated lands of the West, the fertilizing elements
of the sewage would be added to the value of the water, so that
sewage used for irrigation would be worth not merely the value
of the water alone, but also the value of the fertilizer present
in that water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another difficulty in making use of the combined water and
fertilizer is that the large amount of water involves a large area
of land and suitable soil, on which irrigation may be practised,
in the immediate vicinity of the city. This combination of
agricultural soil of suitable texture at a suitable price for farming
operations is so seldom found that this in itself usually precludes
any application of the use of sewage for irrigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of the sewage from a single house, however,
the possibility of making use both of the water and the fertilizer
in sewage is not so difficult. Recent writers on irrigation have
pointed out that, while irrigation of late years has made most
headway in the semi-arid districts of the West, there are many
opportunities for its successful and profitable utilization in the
East, and Mr. Lute Wilcox, in a recent book on irrigation, says:
“The farmer who has a soil containing an abundance of all the
needed elements in a proper state of fineness cannot but deem
himself happy if he have always ready at hand the means of
readily and cheaply supplying all the water needed by his soil
and growing crops, just when and in just such quantities as are
needed. Happier still may he be when he realizes that he need
have no ‘off years’, and he knows that the waters he admits
to his fields at will are freighted with rich fertilizing elements
usually far more valuable to the growing crops than any that
he can purchase and apply at a costly rate—a cost that makes
serious inroads upon the profits of the majority of farmers
cultivating the worn-out or deteriorated soils in the older States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>year by year. Fertilizers are already needed for the most
profitable culture on many farms in Iowa, Minnesota, Eastern
Kansas, and Nebraska, in Missouri, and in all States east of
those named.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the greatest uncertainty in the matter of farming
is the available water coming from the clouds. In one year
the rainfall may come at the proper time to moisten the seed
and to insure a rapid germination. These early rains may be
followed by showers at proper intervals to supply the little
rootlets with the necessary moisture so that the growth of the
plant may be constant and vigorous. During the ripening
season the rains may be withheld so that the harvest is insured
under the most favorable conditions. In other years, however,
the spring rains may be so continuous as to cause the seeds
to rot, requiring a second sowing. Then the rains may fail so
that the seeds either fail to germinate, or at best produce scattered
and imperfect growths. At the time of harvest storm
may follow storm, so that the harvesting of those plants which
have developed is made almost impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Irrigation tends in part to correct these difficulties, since it
furnishes the soil with the needed water at times when the lack
of rain would cause an entire failure in future growth. Irrigation,
of course, cannot prevent rainfall, and it may be that
after a copious soaking of the ground with the irrigating water
a heavy rain may follow, resulting in an excess of moisture as
bad for the ground as none at all. The possibility of irrigation
cannot prevent excessive rains at the time of harvest, but the
advantages of being able to control the soil moisture during the
period of growth are more than enough to counterbalance any
possible disadvantages. During the summer months evaporation
is very high, the dryness of the air and the high temperature
combining to draw moisture from the soil in considerable quantity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Then, too, the plants themselves, while absorbing moisture
from their roots, evaporate moisture through their leaves,
and agricultural stations have made extensive studies on the
amount of this evaporation from different plants. The teaching
of it all is that the amount of water which can be utilized by
the soil, not merely for the sake of the growth of the plants
themselves, but to make up for the demands of evaporation,
is very high.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Newell, of the United States Geological Survey, points
out that while the amount of water required for raising crops
varies according to soil and other conditions, yet a large quantity
is required to maintain the soil in such a degree of saturation
as to best promote the vitality of the plant life. He shows that
for each ton of hay raised upon an acre, from three hundred to
five hundred tons of water must be furnished either by rainfall
or by artificial means. In other words, since water covering
an acre to a depth of one inch weighs about one hundred and
thirteen tons, it would be necessary to cover an acre to a depth
of from three to five inches if that acre produced one ton of hay.
From actual conditions, he shows that it has been necessary,
in order to produce five tons of barley hay per acre, to provide
an amount of water which would cover the acre to a depth of
twenty inches. Although his figures have special reference to
the semi-arid regions of the West they furnish a guide for the
amount of water which may profitably be used in addition to
the rainfall, which, in the summer months, may be practically
nothing even in the East. From three to six inches in depth
each month is his estimate of the needed water for successful
crop growing, the difference depending upon the character of
the soil, more being required in sandy soils and less where the
texture is finer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sewage from an ordinary household, on the basis of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>30 gallons per head per day, amounts to 180 gallons per day, or
about 5,400 gallons per month, or 720 cubic feet. This amount
of water would cover an acre of ground to a depth of a little less
than one-fourth of an inch, and it is plain that in order to have
the sewage of a single house furnish the necessary amount of
water for successful crop growing, the area required is only
about one-twelfth of an acre, or an area about 60 feet square.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the early days of the English experiments with the disposal
of sewage, great stress was laid on the value of the manurial
elements in sewage, and many tests were made as to the capacity
of various soils for absorbing the moisture present in sewage.
One of the most enthusiastic advocates of this method of disposing
of sewage was Mr. J. Bailey Denton, who was able to
act as engineer for many installations of various sorts. As a
result of his experience he came to the conclusion that while
the area depended upon the character of the soil, and while
with the most suitable soil a very large amount of water might
be taken care of, under ordinary conditions it was safest to so
design the works that no possibility of overloading the soil
with water could exist. He places the limits of population,
the sewage from whom would be cared for on an acre, between
1,000 persons per acre and 100 persons per acre. More recent
experience, together with constant observation of farms established
in the early period of the practice, indicates that the
higher value is too great, and that where agricultural processes
alone are considered, 100 persons per acre is a suitable maximum
value for irrigation on sandy loam, and that 40 persons per
acre is a suitable number where the soil is inclined toward
density and fine texture. Six persons in a household would,
according to Mr. Denton, require from one-seventh to one-seventeenth
of an acre. The amount, indicated by the computations
made earlier, indicated one-twelfth of an acre for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the same number of persons. The practical agreement of the
two methods of computing the area necessary thus makes it
possible to determine in either way the amount of land needed
on a given farm for disposing of the household sewage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect of sewage irrigation has been found to be most
astonishing so far as the increased yield of the soil goes. Some
years ago, in order to determine just the effect of the addition
of sewage to ordinary farm land, a certain field of five acres
was divided into four equal parts. The four fields were treated
as follows: Field No. 1 received no sewage. Field No. 2 received
six inches of sewage over its entire area on each of five successive
months. Field No. 3 received twelve inches of sewage on each
of five successive months. Field No. 4 received eighteen inches
of sewage on each of five successive months. The following
table shows the results of three successive years’ experiments
at the sewage farm referred to at Rugby, England, the figures
being the number of pounds of green grass cut from the fields.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be noticed that, whereas without sewage the amount of
green grass was about eight tons on an acre and a quarter in
the field, from lot No. 2 twenty-four tons were cut, from lot
No. 3 thirty-six tons, and from lot No. 4 thirty-eight tons.
Evidently the amount of sewage applied did not proportionately
increase the yield in lots 3 and 4, and it may be said that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>depth of sewage or water of more than twelve inches per acre
has, in general, been found to be not merely unnecessary, but
undesirable. The table does not show the number of cuttings
made during the season, but the custom on the farm is to cut
frequently, at intervals of perhaps two or three weeks, no time
being given for curing the hay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crops suitable for growth on irrigated fields have been
found by experience to be grass and root crops, such as beets,
turnips, and the like. Mr. Wilcox, in writing of the requirements
of different plants, suggests celery as a garden crop that
needs a great deal of water. Beets, carrots, parsnips, and turnips
are favorite plants for irrigated fields. Cabbage and cauliflower
are benefited by abundant irrigation during the first part
of their growth, but after the heads of the cabbage plants are
half-formed, further excessive use of water is undesirable.
The use of irrigating water in orchards has been practised with
great success not only in the recent irrigation areas of the West,
but along the Hudson River and in New England. The size
of the fruit is increased by irrigation, and it is said that the
bloom is much improved.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Methods of Applying the Water</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>In distributing the water or sewage over the soil in the
case of a single house, no elaborate methods are required. In
the case of large farms supplied with sewage from a considerable
population, elaborate systems of piping or open-channel conduits
are required, and the problem of working out and adjusting
the necessary sizes and grades becomes a complicated matter
for which engineering knowledge and experience are required.
But for the small flow which comes from individual houses and
from the small area involved, no such elaborate preparations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>are required. The essence of the distribution consists in carrying
the water onto the field to be irrigated at such a low velocity
that no surface soil or valuable manures are washed away;
and in adjusting the volume of the flow and the requirements
of the soil, there are three characteristic conditions which require
different treatments.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, the area may be practically level and the
crop raised may be either grass or grain. In such a case the
sewage should be led onto the field which may properly be enclosed
on four sides with a low, that is, six to twelve inches,
earth-dike, and at each irrigation the field may be flooded
about two inches deep. The next irrigation would probably
not be required for a week, so that this method requires a number
of beds to be worked one after another and, except where
the soil is very dense, so much so that percolation is very slow,
this method is not suitable because of the slow rate at which
the sewage is delivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second method of distribution, and one more suitable for
the conditions under discussion, is to lay out the field in parallel
beds from three to six feet wide and from forty to one hundred
feet long. These beds are separated by furrows into which
the sewage is discharged. If the grade of these furrows is
properly adjusted to the porosity of the soil, that is, made about
six inches in one hundred feet for open, sandy loam, and about
two inches in one hundred feet for fine, clay loam, the soil will
absorb the needed moisture as the sewage flows over it and
there should be no ponding or excess of water at any point of
the field. By dividing the field into three parts, or in arranging
the flow of sewage so that it enters only two or three furrows
at a time, the flow can be so changed from day to day as to
furnish all parts of the area with the irrigating water, and at
the same time not overload and choke the soil particles. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the beds may be planted and grown whatever vegetables are
desired. A good basis for determining the area and length
of furrows required is to provide a length of thirty feet of furrow
for each person of the household. The total length thus obtained
should not, however, be made continuous, but should be arranged
in three parts, or in multiples of three, so that one-third of the
total length only may be used on any one day, the other parts
serving for other days, so that a rotation is practised.</p>

<div id='fig48'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 48.</span>—Distribution of Sewage and Arrangement of Check Levees on a Hillside.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The third condition involves the application of the sewage
to a steep slope, and this may be treated in either one of two
ways. The sewage may be led to the top of the hill and allowed
to flow, for a short distance only, over the surface on which,
presumably, grass is to be grown. If the length of the furrow
is more than about a dozen feet, the flowing stream acquires
enough velocity to wash the surface and to form gullies. To
prevent this, a secondary ditch or small bank is thrown up
to arrest the flow. The water is led out again from behind this
ditch or bank at intervals, to repeat the process further down the
hill (see Fig. <a href='#fig48'>48</a>). If the slope of the ground is moderate, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>that there is no tendency of the water to form gullies, the
water may be let out of the ditch at intervals and allowed to
distribute itself over the field, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig49'>49</a>. The water
thus overflowing should be collected in a drain at the lower
end of the slope, and will be found suitably purified for discharge
into any running stream not used for drinking purposes.
The occasional use of a shovel or hoe may be needed to change
the flow of the water over the field if it is found that any tendency
exists for definite channels to be formed.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 49.</span>—Distribution of Sewage on a Hillside of Moderate Slope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In order to plant vegetables on such a hill, small furrows
may be made along the hill and laid out with great care so that
the flow of sewage in the furrows shall be only at a slow velocity,
so slow that the soil can absorb the moisture as the water
passes along. By zigzagging this furrow back and forth down
the hillside, vegetation on the hill will receive the benefit of the
water, and if any of the sewage succeeds in reaching the bottom
of the hill, it will be so purified that it may be safely discharged
into any depression or watercourse there found.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>In the case of orchards, irrigation is practised by flooding
the ground around the tree, being careful, however, to throw
up a mound of earth around the tree so that no water comes
within two feet of the tree itself. Fig. <a href='#fig50'>50</a> shows a Western
method of forming square beds, each bed about twenty feet
on a side, with one tree at the centre. Furrows are also used
to distribute the water, a common
practice followed being to
being to have the furrow always under the
extreme edge of the foliage, thus
discharging the water in the vicinity
of the tender rootlets of the
tree. Usually the furrow system
is carried only in one direction, so
that  the  application of  water  by
this method is not so complete as
by the flooding method. But for
small volumes of water constantly
applied, it is probably more satisfactory.
Fig. <a href='#fig51'>51</a> shows a grain field
irrigated by the furrow method.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 50.</span>—Square Beds for Orchards According to Some Western Practice.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In all cases where irrigation is
practised, stress is laid by those
experienced in the matter on the
necessity of cultivation of the soil
in connection with the irrigation. Apparently, there is a tendency
for the surface layers, with the application of water, to
cake or crust over the lower strata, thus depriving the soil of
the necessary air. In order to break up this crust, the soil
must be continually worked, either by a hoe or rake or some
sort of horse cultivator. Where the ground is shaded, as in
the case of land covered with grass or grain, the tendency to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>crust is not so marked, but on cultivated land where root
crops are grown the cultivator must be used regularly
after each irrigation. Where the sewage is carried onto the
field in furrows, the soil in the furrow should be hoed at
frequent intervals, not only to break up the crust which deprives
the soil of the air, but in order to open the particles
of soil for the reception of the irrigating-water.</p>

<div id='fig51'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_118.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 51.</span>—Grain Field in Spring, in Process of Irrigation.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It must also be remembered, as has been pointed out before,
that the success of any method of applying sewage to soil
depends upon the frequent change from bed to bed, the actual
time interval depending on the character of the soil. If the soil
is fine, the same area may be used for a week at a time, and
then given two weeks’ rest. If the soil is more open, this interval
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>should be reduced, and with very coarse particles it may be
found desirable to shift the flow from one bed to another after
an interval of a few hours only. Experience and careful observation
on the moisture-carrying capacity of the bed is the best
guide to the operation of sewage irrigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether or not this method of disposing of the sewage of
a single house is to be selected depends largely upon the slope of
the ground from the house toward the garden. It is not desirable
to have sewage exposed to the air in the immediate vicinity
of a dwelling-house. Rarely would any odors be generated to
such an extent as to be offensive to the occupants of the house,
since the sewage sinks into the ground before putrefaction of
the organic matter sets in and the exposed material left on the
surface of the ground is of too attenuated a type to become
offensive even if it does putrefy before drying. There is, however,
the danger of odors being formed where distribution is
imperfect and where pools are allowed to form in the furrow.
There is also the danger of the transmission of disease germs
from the sewage-irrigated field to the occupants of the house
through the agency of flies. Health statistics of English farms
show this danger to be a very remote one, since the health of
the workman on those farms is as good or better than the
average throughout England. But the possibility of infection
exists and must not be overlooked.</p>

<p class='c000'>No method of disposal requires so much and such constant
care, although the results show in the improved yield from the
farm. This method of broad irrigation is emphatically not the
method to be used except where labor is adequate for proper
soil cultivation and where this labor can be given constantly
and ungrudgingly. Finally, it must be pointed out that care
should always be exercised to prevent irrigating sewage coming
in direct contact with any of the soil produce. Certainly sewage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>should not be used to sprinkle over lettuce or celery or strawberries,
even if the yield is thereby increased. Undoubtedly
any disease germs thus distributed over the fruits and vegetables
would, through the antiseptic action of the sunlight and air,
soon be destroyed, but the very method of irrigation is repulsive,
and the danger, while slight, is sufficient to forbid that method
of fertilizing. No statistics, however, are available to show
that cows eating sewage-irrigated grass are adversely affected
in health, and for years the practice of thus pasturing cows
has been carried on in England. For human beings, however,
vegetables grown in soil that is separated from the sewage by a
foot or more is the safer as well as more æsthetic arrangement.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>ESTIMATES OF COST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In order to estimate the cost of installing a sewage-disposal
plant and of treating continuously the sewage from any residence,
certain fundamental assumptions are always necessary.
In the first place, the unit cost of the manual labor which forms
so large a part of the total cost of construction must be known
for the particular time and place, and perhaps no item in the
cost of construction is so important as this. In a great many
small installations it may be excluded altogether, since all the
hand work required is contributed by the householder at such
times as the other work of the place may allow, without any
additional cost. In other places, if a money value be placed
on such labor, it may be expressed in terms of the cost of a
hired man whose rate of wages, paid monthly, in addition to
board, would be always less than if wages were paid to day
laborers living at their own homes. Again, in the southern
part of the country labor may be had for $1.25 a day, whereas
in the central portion of the United States it is necessary to pay
$1.75 a day, and in the extreme West from $2.00 to $3.00 a day
for common labor. Often, too, the working day is of different
length in different parts of the country. In the estimates which
follow, labor is assumed to cost $1.60 for eight hours’ work,
that is, at the rate of twenty cents an hour. If, in adapting
the estimates of this chapter to any particular installation, the
question of labor may be neglected because of the fact that the
householder will himself do all the required work, then the item
of labor cost may be eliminated. If other units than those
here assumed are suitable for the particular locality where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>any plant is to be built, then the labor item must be modified
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Material.</em>—The cost of material always varies very greatly in
different parts of the country. This is partly because of different
freight and other transportation rates between the factories
where material is made up and the particular place where that
material is to be used; and partly because the profits made
by the middleman increase as the material gets further and
further away from the centres of civilization. Thus, in a large
city six-inch sewer pipe may be sold in such large quantities
that the freight rate is low and the dealer is satisfied with a
small profit on each foot of pipe. In the country districts the
dealer sells but little, and feels that he must have a larger profit
to compensate him for the expense of keeping the material on
hand. Thus, six-inch sewer pipe may be had at prices ranging
from six cents up to sixteen cents per running foot, depending
on the store from which it is bought.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is evident, therefore, that it will not be possible to name
any unit price which will be generally applicable, and it will
be necessary for any intending builder to secure from local
firms the unit prices from which his own individual estimate
may be made up. The following discussion, however, will
indicate the items comprising the necessary estimate, and will
furnish an example by which the estimate sheet can be prepared.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Laying Sewers and Drains.</em>—The main drain from the house
to the sewage disposal plant is of five- or six-inch pipe generally,
the former being sufficiently large and a little cheaper than the
six-inch pipe. The latter has the advantage of size and consequent
greater freedom from clogging. The cost of five-inch pipe
at a store in a village of any considerable size should be ten
cents per foot, and the cost of six-inch pipe twelve cents per foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>This pipe weighs twelve and fifteen pounds per foot respectively,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and, with an ordinary wagon, fifty feet of six-inch pipe,
weighing about eight hundred pounds, is a load; if four trips a
day are possible from the residence to the store and if the cost
of the team is estimated at $4 a day, each trip will cost $1,
and each foot of pipe will cost two cents more for being hauled
from the store to the grounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>In laying the pipe, cement and sand are necessary for joints.
For both kinds of pipe there is required about one cubic foot
of mortar for each fifty joints, the mortar being sufficient to
fill the joints and to make a collar or ring outside. In order to
make this cubic foot of mortar, half a bag of cement and half a
cubic foot of sand will be required. The cost of the cement out
of the village store is about fifty cents a bag, although in a
small place it may be seventy-five cents, or even one dollar.
If one were buying cement in large quantities, a price as low
as thirty cents a bag might be had. If the cement is delivered
in cloth bags, a rebate of ten cents a bag is usually given if the
bag is returned in good condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of sand is usually dependent upon the cost of hauling.
It will require forty minutes to shovel one yard of sand into
a wagon, or at twenty cents an hour it would cost about
fifteen cents. The cost of shovelling sand through a screen
depends upon the amount of material which has to be rejected,
since only a certain proportion of the sand is available for all that
is shovelled. The cost of this shovelling is again about fifteen
cents per cubic yard of material shovelled, and if one-third of it
is coarse gravel which has to be rejected, one and one-half
yards would have to be screened for every yard of sand available,
and the cost would, therefore, be twenty cents for screening,
a total cost of sand in the wagon of thirty-five cents per yard.
If four loads of sand can be delivered per day, with a cost of
fifty cents per hour for team and driver, the sand will cost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>$1.35 per yard on the grounds, this amount being increased or
decreased if the number of trips per day must be made less
or more.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Excavation.</em>—The cost of excavation depends on the character
of the material and on the amount of water present, the
cost of pumping or bailing the latter, if in large quantity, adding
materially to the cost of shovelling. The material through
which the trenches are driven may vary from a sand which can
be shovelled without loosening, to solid rock which must be
blasted, an intermediate condition of soil being known as hardpan
and its excavation costing nearly as much time and effort
as rock itself. If the soil is sand, into which a shovel or spade
can be pushed without any picking of the material, the cost,
as already stated, will be about fifteen cents a cubic yard for
shovelling, and if the excavation is in trench and not more than
six feet deep, the entire trench can be excavated for seven
and a half cents a lineal foot. It is very unusual, however,
to have conditions so favorable that such a low price can be
counted on. If the material requires picking, instead of fifteen
cents a cubic yard it will cost thirty cents a cubic yard, and a
trench two feet wide and six feet deep will cost fifteen cents a
running foot instead of seven and a half cents. If care is not
taken at the start to throw the dirt well back, it will be necessary
to re-handle the dirt from the bottom of the trench, throwing
it back on the pile, and this will add from five to ten cents a
cubic yard, depending on what proportion of the entire excavation
has to be re-handled. In the excavation for a tank, it is quite
possible that the entire material may have to be re-handled and
the cost thus be increased by fifteen cents a cubic yard. If the
ground is very hard, as when boulders and clay are intermixed,
it may require twice as much time for loosening as for shovelling,
in which case the cost of digging the trench will be forty-five cents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a cubic yard, or twenty-two and a half cents per lineal foot,
with five or ten cents added if the material has to be re-handled.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the material is a loose sand or gravel, the trench will
probably require sheeting, that is, boards or planks on each
side of the open trench with braces between, in order to prevent
caving of the banks. If new lumber has to be purchased for
this purpose and its cost added to the cost of excavation, an
additional sum per cubic yard or per lineal foot will be added,
somewhat in proportion to the total amount of excavation
to be done. Finally, if the soil through which the trench is
being dug contains water, it may be necessary to have one or
two men continuously pumping during all the time that the
excavation is going on, and this also will add to the cost per
cubic yard or per lineal foot of the trench.</p>

<p class='c000'>Refilling may be done by hand or may be done by a drag
scraper at the end of a rope, so that the team of horses may be
on one side of the trench and draw into it from the other side
the excavated material. This costs only five cents per cubic
yard. If the dirt is thrown back by hand, the cost will be that
of shovelling, namely, about fifteen cents per cubic yard. If the
dirt has to be tamped in the trench, the cost will then be that
of another man, and backfilling will often add thirty cents a
cubic yard to the cost of excavation.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a summary, it may be said that excavation alone in earth
may cost from fifteen cents to forty-five cents a cubic yard,
and that backfilling may add to this from five to thirty cents
a cubic yard, the entire cost, therefore, varying from twenty
cents to seventy-five cents a cubic yard for excavation and backfilling
together. Nor is it possible to be more definite in explaining
the proper price to put on excavation since the character
of the material and the nature of the excavation are of such
importance in fixing that cost. If the excavation is for a tank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>it is often possible to rig a derrick with a long arm on the side
of the excavation and, by means of a bucket, transfer the
excavated material from the hole to the bank cheaper than
by repeated shovelling or by carrying out the dirt in a wheelbarrow.
Wheelbarrow work is always expensive, the cost of
transporting earth in a wheelbarrow a distance of fifty feet
being about ten cents a cubic yard. Sometimes a horse may be
used to great advantage to lift the bucket and operate the
derrick in place of a hand-worked windlass, although the use
of the horse is hardly worth while unless the excavation is more
than ten feet deep.</p>

<p class='c000'>The excavation for the trenches of a sub-surface irrigation
system cannot be estimated on the same basis as for a larger
trench. More time is required proportionally in trimming and
grading the sides and bottom, so that the cost per cubic yard
is much increased. Thus, while such trenches contain about
one cubic foot of earth per lineal foot, and on the basis of twenty-seven
cents per yard would cost only one cent per lineal foot
to dig, it is probable that, under ordinary conditions, this
amount would be doubled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of underdrains must be made up from the cost
of the pipe used and the cost of the necessary excavation. In the
bottom of artificial filter beds, the latter amounts to little or
nothing. In natural filter beds, the trenches are deeper and
the cost of the underdrainage depends largely on this excavation
cost. The cost of the pipe varies from two to ten cents
per foot, depending on the kind of pipe used and its unit cost.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rock Excavation.</em>—If the trench or the place for the tank is
to be in rock, the cost of excavation is much increased. The rock
must be drilled and blasting powder or dynamite used to loosen
the material so that it can be thrown out later by hand. In
ordinary rock, a man will drill from six inches to twelve inches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of hole per hour, that is, the hole will cost from ten to twenty
cents per lineal foot. The depth of the hole determines the
amount of rock loosened per charge. If the holes are three
feet deep, about one-third of a cubic yard is loosened per hour,
while if the holes are five feet deep, one cubic yard of rock is
loosened per hour. This indicates at once the economical
advantage of deep holes compared with shallow ones. In the
first case, nine lineal feet of hole would have to be drilled in
order to get one cubic yard of rock, nearly double the amount
required where the hole is five feet deep. Usually the distance
between the holes is made equal to the depth of the holes,
although in some rock the depth can, with advantage, be made
greater than that distance. If the rock is very loose and seamy,
deep holes may sometimes not be warranted, because the effect
of the blasting is taken up by the loose rock in such a way that
the value of the explosive is not realized. Shallower holes,
more frequently blasted, utilize the explosive gases more completely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The kind of explosive which may be used varies from slow,
low-power black powder to rapid, high-power nitro-glycerine,
the many forms of dynamite and high-grade powder in use
being combinations of nitro-glycerine with some absorbent. In
most cases, ordinary blasting powder is suitable for rock excavation
in small quantity. It lifts the rock rather than shatters it,
and is more convenient and safe to handle. Forty-per-cent
dynamite is to be recommended where the rock is very seamy
so that quick-acting explosive is essential, and also where the
rock is very hard, so that black powder tends to blow out the
hole rather than to shatter the rock. The cost of forty-per-cent
dynamite is about twenty cents per pound, and the cost
of powder is about twelve cents per pound. On the average,
it may be assumed that it will require one pound of the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and one and a half pounds of the latter per cubic yard of ordinary
rock excavated. The cost of lifting the blasted material out
of the trench will be at about the same rate as that of earth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Concrete.</em>—The walls of tanks made of concrete depend for
their cost upon the cost of the material and the cost of the labor
involved. It is usually more economical to use gravel as the
basis of the concrete if any is available, and in order that the
product may be of good quality it is always best to screen this
gravel, separating it into sand and stone. The proper size of
screen for this operation should be not greater than one-half-inch
mesh. The stone and sand can then be re-combined with
the cement in the proportion of one part of cement to two and
a half parts of sand to five parts of stone, this mixture making
a very strong and impervious combination. The cost of this
mixture depends chiefly on the length of haul for the gravel
and on the natural grading of the material. If the proportions
required for concrete exist naturally in the bank or stream bed
from which the gravel is to be obtained, there is little or no waste
involved in screening, and the only cost is that of handling the
material twice. If, on the other hand, the amount of stone
is inadequate, it may be necessary to waste a good deal of the
fine sand and enough material has to be shovelled to produce
the required amount of coarse media. Assuming that the cost
of shovelling the material from the stream bed is fifteen cents
a cubic yard, and that the haul is two miles, so that four trips
a day are made, then the gravel can be delivered where it is
to be converted into concrete at a cost of one dollar for hauling
and thirty cents for shovelling, while if the haul is only one mile,
so that eight trips a day can be made, the cost will be eighty
cents per cubic yard. If any waste of gravel is necessary, these
costs will be increased correspondingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the site of the proposed plant the sand and gravel must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>be mixed with the cement and carried to place. It has been
found by experience when the mixing is done thoroughly and
by hand, and when the resulting concrete can be shovelled
directly behind the forms, that the cost of the mixing and placing
is about one dollar per cubic yard of concrete. If the concrete
has to be wheeled into place this cost will be added to.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to make a cubic yard of concrete, it is necessary
to have nearly one cubic yard of the coarse material, whether
this be rounded stones from a gravel bank or angular stones
from a stone-crusher. Seven-eighths of a cubic yard of stone
may be safely considered as necessary for a cubic yard of concrete.
To this must be added three-eighths of a cubic yard
of sand for a one to two and a half to five mixture. When this
amount of stone and sand have been thoroughly mixed together,
four and a half bags of cement should be added. Inasmuch as
the variation in sizes of the individual particles of rounded
gravel is such that a dense concrete results naturally, it is quite
reasonable both to increase the amount of stone and decrease
the amount of cement if that variation in size seems to be
one which will produce a dense mixture. Thus one cubic yard
of stone, one-third cubic yard of sand, and four bags of cement
may be used and will, under favorable conditions, result in a
good concrete. In order to determine whether this latter combination
is permissible on any particular piece of work, a test
may be made by thoroughly mixing the materials together in
the proportions named and testing the volume of this mixture
(B) in a box of measured dimensions. Then the same volumes
mixed together in the former proportions (mixture A), and
tested in the same box will show the relative value by occupying
either more or less space than the other mixture (B). If less,
mixture A is a better one, and should be used; if more, then
the latter mixture, B, is the better one.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The amount of water required for mixing concrete depends
upon the temperature of the outside air as well as upon the personal
ideas of the person in charge of the mixing. Some builders
like wet concrete and some like dry concrete. It should be
noticed, however, that wet concrete is cheaper because it requires
little or no tamping. Wet concrete, however, should be spaded,
that is, a spade forced down into the mixture, particularly
against the forms, so that particles of air caught between the
stones may escape, and so that there may be no pockets between
the stones into which the liquid cement mixture does not penetrate.
It is generally considered that about fifteen per cent of
the volume of concrete is the necessary volume of water for the
mixture. This amounts to thirty gallons, or a barrel of water,
to a yard of concrete, although the sizes of barrels vary, and a
cement barrel would not be large enough, and a road-oil barrel
would be too large.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cost of forms depends, again, on the cost of material
and on the cost of labor. Rough lumber varies in price from
twenty to forty dollars a thousand feet, board measure, delivered
on the grounds, and the cost of framing and placing it
varies from eight to twenty dollars per thousand, depending
on the skill of the carpenters and on their daily wages. In order
to estimate the cost of the lumber required for building false
work, it is best to determine exactly the amount of lumber
required, and get the price from a lumber yard on that quantity.
Ordinarily, it is safe to say that a carpenter in building forms
will be able to saw and nail in place 250 board feet per day, so
that, knowing the amount of lumber to be used and the wages
of the carpenter, it will be easy to determine the cost of the
forms as first set up. They may be taken down and removed for
the purpose of re-assembling in another place for about half the
cost of placing originally, and by carefully arranging to build the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>forms in panels or sections, they may be removed by a carpenter
at the rate of 4,000 or 5,000 board feet per day.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Valves.</em>—In connection with a sewage-disposal plant, valves
are essential at many points. At the entrance to the several
parts of the settling tank, flap valves are suitable to admit or
keep out sewage from the several compartments. Gate valves
are used on the by-pass lines and on connecting lines between the
tank and the filter beds in order to be of service when it is
occasionally necessary to clean the beds. More simple valves
may be used in manholes where a diversion of the flow is required
and where perfect and complete water-tightness is not essential.
These valves may be made of plank, sliding up and down in
grooves left in the concrete walls for that purpose. Sludge valves
may be made to fit in the bottom of the tank, and depend for
their water-tightness on the weight of the valve itself with the
aid of a rubber packing which is placed between the valve and
its setting. The cost of these various kinds of valves cannot
be given exactly, since their cost depends upon freight and
profit of the various commission men through whom the valves
are ordered, but, generally speaking, they will be found to differ
but little from the costs given in the following table:</p>

</table>

<p class='c000'><em>Dosing Devices.</em>—Dosing devices referred to in Chapter III
are usually purchased directly from the manufacturer, and while
their cost varies a little, depending upon the cost of freight,
an ordinary single automatic siphon may be estimated at $15,
the difference in price varying a little with the different makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of siphon. If an alternate discharge is required, then two siphons
must be installed, by means of which alternate intermittency
is secured, the variation, however, being only from one to the
other and back again to the first. If a plural alternate discharge
is to be used, the cost may be estimated roughly for a 6–inch
siphon at from $50 to $75 for each unit, this price including the
necessary piping but not the cost of setting.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Filling Material.</em>—Artificial sand filters require a sand of
uniform size and one free from dirt. These two requirements
add very materially to the cost of sand, since it is almost impossible
to find a natural sand which fulfils the necessary requirements.
A few sections of the country are fortunate in having
sand in the vicinity suitable for filtration purposes without
any washing or screening. Such parts of the country, however,
are limited to those where sand has been deposited by glacial
action, and is essentially silicious in character. It is hopeless
to expect to find suitable sand in the centre of New York State,
for example, and even with washing and screening, sand in this
locality is far from being desirable. It will be found, further,
that after this undesirable sand is washed and screened the
cost of the final product is so great that it is usually cheaper
to use broken stone either as a filter or as a contact bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Washing sand in small quantities is done by throwing the
sand into a channel through which water is passing, the sand
being retained by a series of low partitions in the channel.
If the water enters the box or channel through a pipe at the
bottom, frequent entrance holes being provided along the sides
and bottom of this pipe, the sand is kept in a state of suspension,
the dirt more readily washed out, and a much smaller amount
of water used. The cost of shovelling the sand into the washer
and again out of the washer, about thirty cents per cubic yard,
must be added to the original cost of the sand. The cost of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>water, if pumped by hand or by steam, will be about ten cents
per cubic yard of sand cleaned, making the total cost about
forty cents per cubic yard. If only three-fourths of the unwashed
sand is available for use, then the cost of the final product
is a little less than fifty cents per cubic yard. The sand before
being brought to the washer will have been sifted at an additional
cost of perhaps thirty cents per cubic yard. Hauling
from the bank to the washer, or from the washer to the site of
the disposal works, or both, if the water supply requires the
washer to be placed at some distance from the sand bank, will
add from fifty cents to one dollar a yard to the costs already
indicated. It may generally be assumed that it will be impossible
to put sand into an artificial filter for less than $1.50 a
cubic yard, and it may easily cost $2.50 a yard if the sand bank
is at considerable distance from the site of the works.</p>

<p class='c000'>Broken stone in most parts of the country can now be bought
from a stone-crushing plant. If road construction has been in
progress in the vicinity, the contractor for the work has been
obliged to open a quarry and set up a crushing-and-screening
plant, and it will generally be possible to buy broken stone
from such a contractor at about fifty cents per cubic yard.
The cost of hauling and the cost of shovelling into the beds must
be added to determine the cost of the stone in place. Sometimes
it is cheaper to bring the stone from a distance by rail, such stone
costing about $1.25 at the railroad station. Then the cost of
hauling and shovelling must be added. It will be noticed that
the cost of stone does not differ materially from the cost of sand,
and since the amount of stone needed is only about one-quarter
of the sand needed, it is generally cheaper to build a stone bed.
The purification, it will be remembered, however, is decidedly
inferior.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Finishing.</em>—There is always some slight expense necessary in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>finishing and cleaning up after any piece of construction work.
Material left over has to be hauled away, and in order to leave
the plant in an attractive dress, seeding or sodding the earth
slopes is desirable. It is even desirable to plant shrubbery
around the edges of the beds, partly as a screen and partly to
minimize the offensive suggestions which seem to be inseparable
from any plant dealing with sewage. The cost of these final
improvements may be as little or as much as the owner and
builder chooses, but it is urged that their value should not be
overlooked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following table is given as a guide and help in putting
together the various items that make up the total cost of a
sewage-disposal plant. Each line should be carefully considered,
and if the item mentioned is to be used or paid for, the amount
in the last column should be filled out.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cost of Maintenance.</em>—As to the cost of maintenance, very
little that is definite can be said. Sub-surface irrigation plants
should require no expenditure except for the occasional cleaning
of the sedimentation tank. If this is emptied three times a
year, the labor needed would amount to about a half-day’s time
on each occasion for a family of ordinary size. For sand filters,
either natural or artificial, the tank must be emptied as with
sub-surface irrigation, and, in addition, the surface must be
scraped occasionally, and at the approach of winter furrows
must be dug. Perhaps two days’ time would be all that would
be needed for a plant dealing with the sewage of a single family.
A broken-stone bed requires no attention for seven or eight
years, and then the stone has to be shovelled out, washed, and
replaced.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>In none of the installations is this excessive in comparison
with the benefits received, and it should not be considered a
burden to expend this amount of time in maintaining so important
a part of the household economy as the disposal of the
household wastes in a sanitary manner. It must not be forgotten,
however, that no sewage-disposal plant is exempt from occasional
break-down or accidents, and that there must be a constant
supervision exercised. This supervision should not require much
more time than above suggested, but should be exercised for
the purpose of correcting irregular flows or distribution before
the value of the plant is utterly destroyed.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
